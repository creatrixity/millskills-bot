<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Patrick
and I have a friend named Goose. He is a very interesting man. To
meet him you might think he was homeless, and our guess is he goes
through stints of homelessness as he ebbs and flows through the
struggles of his life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">He
rides a bike with a trailer, usually sports a Utilikilt, and he can
often be found dumpster diving—it’s one of his favorite hobbies.
He has some medical issues that have led him down the path of
substance abuse, and his personal life is strewn with many tragedies
that have left him primarily alone and with a deep sorrow that can be
palpably felt by those in his presence. Goose is also a Mensa member,
meaning he is one of the most intelligent people on the planet.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">One
day I had him up to the house to help out with some yard work, and we
got into some absorbing conversation. “What do you think is the
meaning of life?” I asked him. Goose looked up from his work and
looked into my eyes and very matter-of-factly told me, “Love. It’s
love, of course.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_1eb6f74uofsv"></A>
<I>Of</I><I> course?</I> Here was a man who had been stripped of
almost all love in his life telling me he still believed it was the
meaning of life. He went on further to say, “Life is tricky that
way. Almost everything in the world works against it. There are so
many hurdles to overcome to get to love, but then I guess that is
what makes it so damn special.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">So
there you have it. Perhaps the meaning of life is love. To the extent
that the meaning of life is the purpose of life or what makes life
worthwhile, we believe love is essential.<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">
</SPAN></FONT>Our love, not only for each other but for ourselves,
our parents, children, friends, and life itself, brings us not only
our greatest moments of pleasure and joy but also our greatest
challenges pushing us to growth. Love has become the major reason we
do almost anything. You may not agree with us, but it is difficult to
argue that love isn’t something very special we seek as human
beings in this life—even if it means overcoming difficult or
painful obstacles to do so.</P>

may be happy and fulfilled in your current relationship, and you
picked up this book because you know you can always get better, go
deeper, and grow your love further. Or you may be at a crossroad. You
may not be happy in your relationship anymore and might be thinking
about calling it quits; you may be feeling stuck in the relationship
doldrums and are seeking relief. Maybe you want to bring the spice
back to your relationship.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Whatever
your reasons, we hope you are here to learn, to improve, to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>endeavor</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
to be better. We want you to be able to say, beyond a shadow of a
doubt, that you have given it your absolute all because we believe no
one should walk away from a significant relationship—especially a
marriage—until they can say that. Whether you find yourself seeking
to rediscover your love, passion, and romance, just need a tune up,
or if you are just here to learn more, keep reading.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">But
a word of warning: If you are no longer willing to work on your
relationship, then I will save you some time. Put this book down;
it’s not for you. Be certain to ask yourself this one question
before you go: By walking away, what good will I take with me into my
next relationship? Barring abusive relationships, if things aren’t
working now in your current relationship, it’s likely as much about
you as the other person. If you don’t figure out your part in a
failed relationship, it’s likely you’ll continue to repeat the
negative cycles. Maybe you should keep reading? It may shed some
light on what went wrong and how to take a different approach the
next go round.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If
we didn’t piss you off with the warning, we have great news: You
don’t need to read fifty relationship books to get yours on track!
Nor do you need to overwhelm yourself with knowledge and strategies
to get your relationship in sync. You only need a few key mindsets
and a few new behaviors. But it will take work. The strategies we’ll
discuss in these pages are simple to do but challenging to master. No
one is perfect, and you likely will not be either. But, if you work
at it consistently you will see a significant change for the better
and likely have a relationship you might not have thought possible.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">We
believe that by implementing the tools and suggestions in this book,
we can keep the divorce rate under ten percent. That’s thirty to
forty percent less than the national average (</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">according

book is written as HE SAID, SHE SAID, as Sam and I offer up our
individual perspectives. We’re not sure if our gender or sexual
orientation is relevant to this book or not—we don’t think so.
We’re not trying to offer male/female-specific stances, nor are we
speaking only to heterosexual couples. We believe that any romantic
partnership, regardless of the sexual orientation of those partners,
can benefit from implementing the endeavors in this book.</FONT></P>

also need you to know that we are just normal people; we’re not
PhDs; we are not psychologists; we have not been studying millions of
relationships for ump-teen years. We are just one of the happiest
married couples we know, and we work very hard to stay that way. We
weren’t always happy, but we’ve figured out a few things, and it
feels selfish not to share what we’ve learned with the world.</FONT></P>

in this second edition of Bigger Love we’ve also added a THEY SAY
to applicable sections. After we wrote the first edition of the book

couples and various people who did research or worked as
professionals in the area of love and relationships. We started

<B>HE SAID:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">It
took me about a month to realize that I was dating the woman I wanted
to marry. Too soon right? Probably. But I had been “interviewing”
women for the previous year or two and was done being single. So when
Sam came along, it was a no-brainer for me. She was different in so
many ways from the rest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
didn’t want to scare Sam off, but I did want to be around her as
much as I could, so I remodeled her parents’ condo in my spare
time. However, given that I was the first to fall madly in love, I
knew I had to try and play it cool until I could get her on the same
page. That took almost three months. I pulled out all stops on
Valentine’s Day, which prompted the first “I love you” from
her. Of course being a typical man, I said something like, “I guess
I do too.” Meanwhile, in my head, I was screaming, “YESSSS! What
the hell took so long??”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_9tw3ap145hlx"></A>
About a month later I was sitting on the edge of her bed, and we were
discussing kids. Like with so many things, we were on the same page.
We both wanted kids while we were still young so that we wouldn’t
be changing diapers in our forties. Sam mentioned she thought I would
be a good dad. She also said, in a thinking-out-loud kind of way more
than she was trying to prompt me, “I won’t have another kid till
I get married, though.” Being the opportunist I am, I charged
through that door with one of the most unromantic wedding proposals
ever:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">“Well
let’s just get married then.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
was so matter-of-fact about it. I’m not sure I was even looking at
her. But Sam didn’t seem to notice and said, “Yeah. Okay.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
were both stone sober, but still woke up the next morning with an “Oh
shit, what did I do?” feeling. When I glanced at Sam, she looked
like she was struggling to comprehend our actions as well. Few words
were spoken as we moved to brush our teeth. I decided I had to be the
one to break the silence. With a mouthful of toothpaste foam, looking
at myself in the mirror (again, not at her) I casually asked, “Did
we decide to get married last night?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Sam
replied with “I …. think so …” We both looked at each other
and smiled sheepishly, but neither of us suggested further
questioning. It was more like “Huh. Well, okay then.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_2jxbflyy09uz"></A>
Three months later we were married on the sunbaked red shores of Lake
Powell, Utah, with about forty friends and family in attendance and
the Reverend E.H Snyder III (Sam’s dad, recently ordained by mail)
conducting the ceremony.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_hnlae7hcsd3y"></A>
While I don’t necessarily recommend a six-month
courtship-to-marriage plan, I won’t discourage it either. There are
just some things you won’t learn until you have made the commitment
and are experiencing the everyday fray. As an entrepreneur who has
had multiple business partners, I can tell you that the courtship and
the honeymoon are rarely safaris where you see the elusive animal
called “true colors.” That takes some time and usually won’t
happen until both of you attain a certain level of comfort and
security.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">For Sam and me, the first
year was incredible, but being young and ignorant we didn’t know it
could get even better. Unfortunately for us, marriage was one of
those things that had to get worse before it could get better. For
me, it was somewhere in year two where I started having second
thoughts and began asking myself if I would be able to hang in for
the long haul. Most of it was between my ears and was quickly fixed
after I had my first epiphany. It had to do with passion, or lack
thereof, something I will talk about later. The correction I made
turned things 180 degrees for me, and we were back on track but not
out of the woods by any stretch.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">There is a transition
that happens in most relationships where the “madly in love”
feeling goes away. You will read a lot more about this in upcoming
chapters. Suffice to say, however, this transition is a major
crossroads that is difficult to navigate without a map. We had no map
and no idea what to do, as most couples don’t. We winged it.
Probably because we were young and smart and didn’t need any help.</FONT></FONT></P>

were all spent in Kansas City, Missouri. That is where we really cut
our teeth in our relationship. We had some ups and downs and fumbled
through the transition semi successfully. We were still in love and
our relationship was still pretty solid. I recognized later I had
some insecurity issues that had popped up a few times and then ducked
back under the surface before any real damage was done. These issues
manifested as jealousy most of the time and I will fill you in on
that part later. It gets its own chapter.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Sam and I didn’t fight
a lot but when we did it was usually about the same things. We
bickered a lot about household chores and spending quality time. Sam
is big on work share inside the house but gives little credit to work
done outside the house. So even if I spent eight hours mowing our ten
acres or rototilling our garden or building a deck off the back of
the house, I would usually catch shit for not picking up after the
kids or throwing in a load of laundry. Basic marriage stuff, right?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Now came the major shift.
Year six we moved back to Salt Lake City, Utah. A few years prior to
the move, I was a hired as a regional manager and partial owner of a
company that was then acquired by UPS. So when we left Kansas City I
was leaving a pretty secure gig. We moved because Sam wanted to be
near her family again. She took a pay cut to move back and we took a
cost of living increase. And now I was out of a job, as UPS had no
need for my position in Salt Lake. I was able to scramble and replace
my salary for the first six months or so, but then I was switched to
commission only and I took a dip. A few months later I took another
job with some equity guarantees and my salary spiked back up again.
Less than a year later I would be taken advantage of and walk away
empty handed. Needless to say, I was up and down with the amount of
bacon I was bringing home in Utah.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Sam had taken a job
working with an outsourcing company in project management. She had to
drive out a month early to begin the job while I finished up mine and
handled the movers in Kansas City. This was a long time apart for us.
My insecurity was likely at a peak as she met new friends and went
out with all of her new (all male) coworkers.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Sam has always been a
fast riser at every job she has had. She moves from co-worker to
upper management quicker than anyone I have seen. With this new job,
the higher up she moved, the more travel they seemed to dump on her.
And while I rode the income roller coaster, her income just kept
climbing. So now we had a growing income gap, a work environment not
conducive to an insecure husband, and travel—lots of travel. This
was where our lack of tools really began to take its toll. We had no
idea how to cope with the additional strain on our relationship or
what to do to reduce it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In year eight I began
working with a start-up. It was again with a guarantee of equity,
this time in writing, but only after we grew a profit. During the
first year, no one would make any income. I still had income from
another business that I had and it kept me about where I had been,
but it required maybe fifteen hours a month. So most of my time was
spent building equity in the new company. Or, as Sam put it: “working
for free.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">That year was our
toughest year ever. It ultimately resulted in our separation. I had
seen it coming. I did not want it however and had made a few
last-ditch efforts to resurrect our marriage. One of which was to set
aside some money and book us a sailing trip in the British Virgin
Islands over the kids’ spring break. This backfired badly. Sam
never knew how much I made because she focused on averages and the
tax return black and white. In my other business I didn’t make much
for the first six months of the year, but it started really ramping
up after that and in November and December I usually made half of my
annual income. That December I had made more than any other, and
setting a few thousand aside for the “surprise” trip was easy.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Well Sam hated that
surprise and accused me of hiding money. Fuck. We went on the trip
and had a pretty good time with the kids, but our conversations all
seemed to have an element of finality to them. What I mean by that is
we talked a lot on this trip about what was wrong, and each time we
seemed further apart and sad. Two months later, Sam suggested we take
some time apart. I found an apartment a few miles away the next day.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">I may have been able to
beg and suggest counseling and gone the usual route, but I tended to
own things and to react with emotion. My emotions were hurt and
anger, and they manifested themselves with this kind of dialogue:
“Fuck her. I won’t be where I am not wanted.” “She wants to
be on her own? Good, now she will see how much help I was really
giving.” “If she thinks there is someone better out there, good
luck keeping that person when he realizes the kind of shit he is
dealing with.” “She took a knee on the one yard line; my
businesses are just getting ready to pay off!” And they were.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">I focused on my business
and that kind of internal dialogue for about five months. At that
time I was in North Idaho visiting my terminally ill cousin and dear
friend. I believe it was also around this time that my other cousin
Dan gave me a much needed verbal bitch slap. “Why don’t you stop
focusing on everything Sam did wrong and why this is mostly her
fault? he said. “Instead focus on your part in all of this. You
have your own shit. Whether you get back together or not, do you want
to haul that baggage with you into the next relationship?”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">That was a huge moment
for me and likely led to another epiphany. I had heard it my whole
life but never really knew what it meant until right then. I only
have control over so much. Sam and her decisions are definitely not
part of it. I need to focus on what I can control which is me, and I
have some work to do. I decided practically on the spot that my own
insecurity was as much at fault as anything else and I would start
changing that now.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Another thing Dan said
was: “You need to stop owning her shit. You own it for days.” I
will expand much more on this in a later chapter. But let me say that
not long after that conversation with Dan I stopped letting Sam’s
moods, her perceptions and her misplaced values be something that I
would let bother me.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">We did have one major
blowup over Christmas, but not many more after that because I refused
to fall back into my old patterns. Our fight over Christmas was of
course about money, which for some reason made me defensive. The
divorce papers were being drawn up. In them I got zero credit for
signing the house over to her. That’s what I get for refusing to
have a lawyer and basically telling her she could have everything
except my tools, my car, our log bed I built, and of course my
baseball cards. I digress.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">She was mad at this time
because her lawyer told her that our tax returns showed that I only
needed to pay $300.00 a month in child support. Forgetting everything
I was working on and allowing myself to be sucked in, I shot back
“You said you make all the money, you said you don’t need me, you
said you wanted to be on your own, so what difference does it make
what the child support number is?” Yeah, that helped.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">A week later I called her
and said, “I don’t want to have the same conversation we had last
week. So how about this, I know you don’t need money to take care
of the kids when you have them, and I will pay when I do. So the
child support number is somewhat meaningless. And we should just
leave it as is in the paperwork and not fight about it. Additionally,
I will deposit $1,000.00 a month into their college fund. I have
already given you everything else, so my word will have to be good
here. I will start by dropping in ten K in January to prepay February
and one thousand for every month we have been apart.”</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">I think this might be
when she realized I was not the broke dick she had been portraying me
as in her own internal and external dialogue. My business had started
paying a decent salary a month or so after we split. I also was teed
up for regular equity splits starting in January. On top of that, my
other business had a great last quarter as always. I had finally
turned the corner. It felt really good to defuse the money argument
with money for a change. This was likely the shedding of one of my
last major insecurities.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The new me had evolved
into a person who had found success, didn’t show insecurities such
as jealousy, did not engage in blowups or shit that had little to do
with me, and finally knew that I would be happy either with or
without her. I think Sam was attracted to the new me all over again.
In May of that year, I invited her to a massage and a sleepover. She
accepted. That night we decided to get back together.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The truth is I never
stopped loving Sam, and I had continued holding out some hope we
could reconcile. And when we agreed to give it another try, I was
elated. We had conditions for each other though and these conditions
were critical to how it came to be. Mine were that she needed to
recognize that her job consumed her and that she was being
manipulated and taken advantage of by the people she worked with.
Fortunately for me she already had connected those dots and wanted to
quit after the summer. That was huge for me as I knew that if she
prioritized our family over her job, we would not fail again.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">I also suggested she not
go back to work for a while after she quit. She agreed and said we
would play it by ear. Aside from a few small projects with her dad
and working in our own business, I am proud to say she has never gone
back to work for another person. If she wants to, I will support her
as my only goal is for her to be happy. But I also know that’s not
what makes her happy. I am forever grateful too because she saved my
ass more than once by being free to help grow our own business.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The last ten years of our
relationship have been nothing short of spectacular. The love
continues to grow, expand and flourish and our foundation is more
solid than ever. It has not been perfect, nothing ever is. But we are
still keen to learn and continue to do so. Much of this book is about
what we have learned since our “almost divorce” and how we
integrated that knowledge to help us even further.</FONT></FONT></P>

<B>SHE SAID:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Patrick
(or Paddy, as I lovingly call him) and I met in 1995 at a party. The
parents of my best friend Nicole (or Nickel, as I lovingly call her)
were hosting a holiday party at their house. Paddy was a friend of
Nickel’s, but that night he was there with a group that had come to
hang out with her parents. Nickel’s parents were and are young at
heart, so their parties brought together a wide variety of people of
all ages and interests.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Paddy
is seven years older than me, which seemed like a big age difference
at the time and that bothered me to begin with. However, we hit it
off immediately, and his gentle, loving ways combined with his
unrelenting persistence soon had me smitten.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
wasn’t the only one who’d fallen for Paddy—my two-year-old son
Jacob <B>loved</B> him. Paddy would greet Jacob with as much
enthusiasm as he greeted me and they seemed to really enjoy playing
together. Soon my son was just as excited to see Paddy as I was. When
Christmas came, Paddy bought him a giant stuffed Pumba (the warthog
from <I>The Lion King</I> and Jacob’s favorite character in his
favorite movie) with bugs you could take in and out of his mouth.
This thing was about as big as Jacob, and he loved it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Having
Jacob and Paddy love each other was hugely important to me. I wanted
a loving family who wanted to spend time together. Finding a partner
who loved my son as much as, or more than he loved me, seemed the
only way to do this. I had dated men who were only interested in me
as a partner and not me as a mother. This caused conflict as these
men were always angling to exclude Jacob and I was always toting him
along. I didn’t want my love for my child to be compromised by my
love for a partner—I wanted to be both a happy partner and mother
all at the same time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">After
three months of dating, we started talking about having another child
together. I didn’t want Jacob to be an only child and be left here
on earth alone when I passed away. (I know what you’re thinking:
<I>That’s a little morbid and premature for a twenty-two-year-old</I>,
but what can I say? I’m an old soul.) I also didn’t want the age
gap between my kids to be so big that they wouldn’t be close. Being
a single mother was very difficult, and I wanted someone who was
committed to helping me raise my kids. And to me, that meant being
married. So Paddy and I decided to tie the knot. It was an abrupt
decision, and it shocked us both when we suggested it, discussed it
and then agreed to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
remember when I told Nickel that I was getting married, she responded
with “To who?” I suppose it was a fair question. I’d been
trying to play the field and had dated a few other guys for the first
few months I was seeing Paddy. In fact, Paddy even babysat Jacob
while I went on a date with another man! (That was part of the
unrelenting persistence I mentioned earlier.) We had a very short
whirlwind romance; we got hitched; we moved from Park City to Kansas
City, Missouri, and had our daughter, Claire, a year later. We lived
in Kansas City for a little over five years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Our
marriage through those first five years, although not perfect, was
satisfactory. We weren’t without our struggles, adjustments,
fighting, and discontentment but we managed to stumble through
without too much damage—or so we thought—but some resentment was
starting to build up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Paddy
is an entrepreneur. He thrives in environments where he calls his own
shots and paves his own way. During the first half our marriage,
Paddy’s moneymaking activities felt like a roller coaster ride of
different side jobs, start-ups, partnerships, and experiments. I, on
the other hand, was a corporate woman. My grandfather and father both
had great success in the corporate world so I followed suit with what
I knew. My career was a steady climb up the corporate ladder,
providing our family with what I thought was stability and financial
security.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">In
2001, we started discussing moving back to Utah. My grandparents were
aging and I wanted to be around to spend time with them before they
passed on. Paddy graciously agreed. I found another corporate job and
Paddy also secured a venture he could pursue in Utah.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">My
new job required extensive travel and Paddy primarily worked from
home. I would often leave town early Monday morning and return late
on Friday evening or Saturday morning.  We frequently pulled late and
all-nighters to meet deadlines and took red-eye flights so we could
get home before heading back out on the road. I would typically
arrive home exhausted to a messy house, piles of laundry, kids
needing baths, hair combing, and other motherly TLC—and a husband
needing attention and other wifely TLC.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">This
put tremendous strain on me and subsequently our relationship. I
often used what little energy I had over the weekends to clean, do
the laundry, get in as much time with the kids as possible, and Paddy
got whatever I might have left—if anything. My priorities in those
days were: number one, providing for our family; number two, the
kids; and Paddy came in last.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
was also building resentment towards Paddy. I felt like since I was
the main financial provider for our family and Paddy was home, he
could at least clean up and do laundry. I was also critical of the
way he took care of our children. He didn’t bathe them as regularly
as I would have, they didn’t eat as well as I would have fed them,
and my husband let them dress themselves and comb their own hair.
Seeing Claire come home from school in her dress-up Cinderella garb
made me feel embarrassed and it would take multiple sessions of
crying and hair combing to work out the rat’s nest at the back of
her neck each weekend—she only brushed the top part.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Then
there was the unending male attention I received at work. When I
started my job in Utah, I was the only woman in my entire division
who was not an administrative assistant. I was often the only woman
working on my teams, and many of my male colleagues became close
friends. As I spent less and less time at home with Paddy, I found
the time I did spend with him more draining than pleasurable. As I
spent more time traveling with those colleagues, some of those
friendships teetered on the line of crushes, and a few tipped over
into the realm of emotional affairs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
was getting all the male attention I could ever want—short of sex
(which as you’ll read about later in this book, wasn’t a high
priority for me). So because it wasn’t physical, I didn’t
consider this to be cheating, technically. This is not what I believe
now. I believe emotional affairs to be as damaging as physical
affairs but the lines aren’t as clear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">My
job had many perks—always traveling first class or in private
planes, limos, five-star hotels, and conferences and meetings in
exotic locations like the Caribbean and Europe. I also received
expensive gifts such as jewelry from Tiffany’s, a Tag Heuer watch,
and thousands of dollars of gift certificates to Nordstrom’s for
holidays and birthdays, or bonuses for closing big deals. I was being
exposed to an entirely different world—the lap of luxury.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
started to feel like, why can’t I have a husband who wears a suit,
works a stable corporate job, buys me a new car for Christmas (one of
my male colleagues had bought his wife a very expensive car for
Christmas!)? Why do I have to be the stable provider? I loved my job
but I also missed my kids and would often cry as my flights left
Utah.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
tried a few things to relieve the pressure and create more space for
family. We hired an amazing nanny, Mel, who lived across the street
with her partner, Sean, and their two children who were the same ages
as our kids. Although this helped with many of the household duties,
it actually seemed to throw gas on the fire of my resentment towards
Paddy. Now not only was I working extremely hard, but my husband who
was working from home was either unable or unwilling to tend to our
household and children, which meant I had to pay someone else to do
it. And Paddy brought in some income but I brought in more than
double and I felt like I was working at least twice as hard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
started wondering, what did I need a husband for anyway? Our sex life
had degraded to nearly nothing, as I felt little to no attraction to
Paddy, who seemed uninterested in anything but hounding me for sex
and attention and riding my ass about being distant. I got all of my
emotional support from friends and male colleagues. I paid a nanny to
take care of my children and my household. I didn’t need his income
to support my lifestyle—and in fact I felt cutting ties would help
my financial situation because I’m a saver and Paddy is a spender
which also caused tension.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
spent about three years muddling through life this way until I
decided being married to Paddy was more trouble than it was worth.
Just a month before our tenth anniversary I told him I was done. We
had a brief discussion of what to do with our assets and Paddy said I
could have them all—the house, the car, our retirement
account—everything. He would essentially be leaving with nothing
but his car.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Shortly
thereafter, I was offered a position in Spain and told him I would
like to move our children to Europe with me. I felt it was an
opportunity of a lifetime for all of us. My company would fly Paddy
out every few months to visit the kids, which would also be a great
opportunity for him. He also thought this would be an amazing
experience for our kids. They would be able to learn another language
or two, see another culture, and he agreed to the move.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">So
we were done. I met with a lawyer and started the process of getting
divorced, moved to Spain with our children, rented out my house in
Utah to friends, and started my new life where the grass would be
greener.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">My
job in Spain was dramatically different from the positions I held in
the States. I was essentially hired to clean up a giant
multi-million-dollar mess our company was making there. I led a very
large team spread all over Europe and was working with mostly new
people. Almost immediately upon my arrival I could feel a new sort of
loneliness of being THE boss and also an outsider—an American—oh,
and again, one of the only women on our management team.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I’d
had the impression my job would require little to no travel, which
appealed to me. I thought I could be with my children more. We rented
a little condo right on the sea in a beautiful medieval town named
Sitges and I enrolled them in the international school. I chose this
town partially because when I went there one night with some people
from work, there were gorgeous men everywhere and I thought these
would be great hunting grounds for my new singleness. (I later found
out Sitges is the unofficial gay capital of Europe. Whoops!)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Paddy
came to visit the kids after those first couple months. I told him he
could stay in our condo and I figured he could be in charge of the
kids for the week since I was again traveling and struggling to find
reliable help. I was surprised by how happy I was to see him. My
first few months on the greener grass had been nothing short of
intense. The job was extremely difficult and demanding—I wasn’t
seeing my children as much as I had hoped—I had only two friends,
Linda and Keith from Canada, but no time or outlets to find new
friends. I was lonely and the familiarity of Paddy was comforting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
hadn’t had an ugly parting of ways, it was friendly and we spoke
often about the kids and how to handle different things. I hadn’t
had sex with anyone since I left him and although we had sex
infrequently, I missed being touched and after a few months I did
start missing sex.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
plan was for Paddy to sleep on the couch but he snuck into my room
the first or second night and we talked and touched and had sex. He
was still as gentle, loving, and persistent as when we met. It didn’t
feel right but it didn’t feel wrong either. It didn’t mean we
were getting back together but it was a nice respite from my new
lonely life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">My
big plans for my new life started to fall apart after three months.
My company was unable to secure visas for my children to legally live
in Spain any longer. The government of Barcelona wasn’t extending
these visas to anyone and none of our team could get them pushed
through. Jacob and Claire had to leave the country while they tried
to sort out the visa issues. I took the kids and our new awesome
Spanish nanny, Alvaro, to work out of our office in London for a
month hoping my team could work something out in the meantime. The
visas didn’t get done and the kids and I went home for Christmas.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">My
stay at home for Christmas was extended. I stayed with my parents and
went into our office where they had set up a new, fancy video
conferencing system for me to use to run my team from Utah while we
sorted out the visa issues. I would arrive to work at the office
around midnight when my teams were starting their days, home around
noon, bed by five, repeat. I got to see the kids a few hours in the
afternoons and every other weekend. And I was always exhausted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
realized a couple things over Christmas. I found my former crushes
and emotional affairs had dissolved to close to nothingness in my
absence—they had been fleeting encounters with those feelings of
being in love. I had been dumped in Europe in the biggest sinking
boat of a business with little of the promised support that was to be
provided from my former teams. I was now going to be seeing even less
of my children than before I took the assignment without their visas.
And my company had already found my replacement to do my former job,
so there was no turning back at this point.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">One
night Paddy and I had dinner. According to our not-quite-final
divorce he would need to pay child support since I had custody of the
kids. It turned into a big fight over $300 a month, which I didn’t
need at all and since the divorce wasn’t final he didn’t think he
needed to pay. I drove home bawling in hysterics. I had no idea why I
was crying until I reached my parents’ house.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
suddenly realized I was extremely unhappy and I had reached this
place because of Paddy. It was his fault that I had to be the big
provider because he never stepped up. So that also made it his fault
that I hated my new job. It was his fault I was lonely. It was his
fault I missed my kids and had missed so much of their childhood—it
was all because he had never given me a chance to stay home with my
kids.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">But
the real epiphany … the real message in that anger had nothing to
do with Paddy at all. The real message was I only thought I wanted a
big career and to travel the world and have expensive things. But
deep down I didn’t give a shit about any of that. I missed my
kids—I wanted to be with them and see them grow up and take care of
them and learn how to cook. The real message in the sorrow was that I
had wasted so many years chasing shiny things and empty fleeting
feelings masked as financial stability. When I had graduated from
college with a degree in international relations, I honestly imagined
my life as being the big boss living as an expat with a full-time
nanny. Turns out I had arrived and it wasn’t anything I really
wanted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">And
Paddy seemed to be getting his financial shit together. Maybe all
those years of roller coaster entrepreneurialism were starting to pay
off? He lived in a nice apartment, he had just bought a new Land
Rover, and for Christmas he bought me beautiful diamond earrings. I
ended up spending the night at his new apartment and we slept
together again. Again, it was so comforting and he was still just as
gentle, loving, and persistent as ever. He also proposed after our
big fight that in lieu of child support—which we both knew I didn’t
need—he would put $1,000 in the kids’ college funds every month.
Again, it wasn’t about the material things—the diamond earrings
or the Land Rover—but it was more a display that Paddy didn’t
really need to rely on me financially. He was making his own way just
fine and maybe better than fine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">On
my next trip home, Paddy asked me on an official date for dinner and
a night at Snowbird lodge. I figured since we had been sleeping
together the whole time we were getting divorced, it was likely I
would put out after a date, so the overnight sounded good to me. It
wasn’t like I was seeing anyone else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
had an amazing night. Paddy told me confidently that night, “I will
be fine—happy—with or without you.” I had never heard anything
so sexy in my life! I had always felt this burden of his reliance on
me—of our family reliance on me—real or not—and the burden
lifted immediately. Not unlike our whirlwind romance when we first
got married, we decided to get back together that very night. I told
Paddy I hated my job and wanted to quit. He told me his business was
booming and he would love it if I quit my job and we all moved home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
planned my exit—hiring two people who were each paid twice what I
was making—to replace me. I always knew I was doing the job of at
least two people and underpaid as a woman. Before my complete exit,
Paddy and I took the kids on an awesome vacation through the North of
Spain—staying in castles, playing in the ocean, and enjoying the
beautiful Spanish countryside, food, and culture.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Once
we got home, while we were at a party at my sister’s house with all
of our friends, Paddy got down on one knee with a gorgeous antique
diamond ring and proposed to me. We had an all-Elvis re-wedding in
Vegas with all of our friends and we’ve truly lived “Happily Ever
After” ever since.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">If
I had to summarize—why did we break up in the first place?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>I
put my career before anything or anyone in my life. </B>I allowed my
job to be my number one priority. I justified this choice by stating
I was supporting my family, but in truth my job gave me lots of
things, including more money than I really needed to support my
family. It brought instant gratification—money, power, prestige,
gifts, trips, luxuries. It gave me lots of positive attention.
Unfortunately, none of these things last, nor are they important to
me personally. I’m happier drinking a Bud Light in a camping chair
in the desert than I am dressed to the nines sipping Champagne at the
Ritz-Carlton. I’m especially happier if my kids and husband are
there!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>I
put my career before anything or anyone in my life. </B>I know I’m
repeating myself but I put my career even before myself. When I was
working that hard, I was not taking care of myself. I ate poorly, I
was out of shape, I didn’t sleep enough, and my stress levels were
through the roof. I practiced zero self-love and when you don’t
take care of yourself, as I showed, you have nothing left for anyone
else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>I
didn’t know myself well enough, or I chose to ignore the things
that are truly important to me. </B>Jacob, Claire, and Paddy are the
most important things in my life. They are why I do anything. I lost
sight of this and it nearly cost me everything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Now
if I have to summarize—why did I <I>want</I> to get back together
with Paddy?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>The
sex was amazing. </B>Paddy is a great lover. I trained him well. It
would likely take years to train anyone else to love me like he does
because I’d been training him for years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Paddy
had new … swagger? </B>Paddy had this confidence when we met—he
told me, “I’ll be a millionaire one day, Sam. I promise you
that.” It had waned while my career soared and his took a bit of a
digger, but during our year apart he got his swagger back. He was
confident again. That was hot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Paddy
loves our kids as much as I do. </B>What do I love the most on this
planet? Jacob and Claire. I fucking love those kids more than
anything. And having that much love for something and knowing someone
else has that much love for something is bonding. It can’t carry a
partnership but if you let it, it can strengthen one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Many
people say we’re very lucky, but we would tell you luck has nothing
to do with it. We work on our marriage. We nurture it to make it what
it is today. And much of that effort is dedicated to working on who
we are as human beings, communicating with one another, and
expressing love. The things we’ve learned along the way (which
we’ve included in these pages) make the work of our marriage
easier, more fulfilling, and deeper. We can’t wait to share them
with you.</P>

are the love of your life.</B> You are the only one who really knows
you, who has been and will be with you every moment of your life from
the cradle to the grave. It seems trite to say, but self-love is a
vital aspect of your ability to love someone else. Your ability to
love, feel gratitude for, and forgive yourself teaches you how to
express those things to others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">That
said, we believe achieving complete self-love is right up there with
achieving total enlightenment. Sure, some people reach it, but most
of us stumble along the path doing our best to find something we know
is elusive. We feel it is more helpful to describe self-love as a
process as opposed to a destination, so we don’t become
discouraged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
are not self-love experts but having seen glimpses of how our
relationship flourishes when we are practicing self-love, we work our
asses off on a daily basis to get just a bit further down that path.</P>

<B>SHE SAID: Why love yourself and how do you get there?</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">In
those years where our marriage started to degrade before our
almost-divorce, I practiced very little (if any) self-love. If I made
mistakes, particularly in business, I would beat myself up for days,
months even. I had zero compassion for screw-ups. I thought to get
sick was weakness and popped pills to take care of the symptoms and
tried to ignore them. If I had successes, I spent very little time
celebrating them before moving on to the next task or project. This
is how I treated myself—it was also how I treated Paddy, Jacob,
Claire, and I took that to another level with every soul who had the
misfortune of reporting to me. I was brutal, first on myself and then
on others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
ate and drank whatever I wanted whenever I wanted, which I can tell
you involved a diet of primarily caffeine, sugar, alcohol, and
popcorn with an occasional swanky dinner at an expensive restaurant.
I sacrificed sleep to finish work, meet deadlines, or party with
co-workers. “Sleep when you are dead” was something of a mantra.
I never exercised—who had time for that?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
was attempting some spiritual life and took up Zen Buddhism, but I
only practiced when I was at home—which was rarely—and when I was
home, I primarily volunteered and taught the kids’ class as a
service to the Zen Center as opposed to engaging in my own practice.
I had given up all hobbies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
had very few friends. I was under extreme pressure to perform and in
the spotlight. My job got all of me, and I thought I really loved it
and the perks. I thought I was fulfilled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">But
there were indicators everything wasn’t peachy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
left nothing for anything or anyone else. I told my children “no”
to many of the things they asked for such as sleepovers, parties, and
excursions because I didn’t have the energy to facilitate them. I
was also not very affectionate—I wasn’t raised in an overly
affectionate family, and honestly, I preferred not to be touched too
much.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Every
vacation we took during those years, I would get really sick to the
point of not being able to leave a hotel room for the first few days
no matter how many pills I popped. I preferred to sleep than go on
excursions with my family. When we were in the Caribbean sailing
through the Virgin Islands, Paddy, Jacob, and Claire went snorkeling,
and I decided to take a nap.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
cried in the car on the way to work almost every morning and on every
flight leaving Utah.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
long-term effects of not practicing self-love were the near demise of
my marriage; having children who heard the words “I love you” all
the time but didn’t really see or feel me expressing love towards
them; health issues I still battle whose causes are rooted in not
taking care of my body during all those years along with the side
effects of not properly managing stress and anxiety. Thankfully, I
learned my lesson:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>You
practice self-care as a form of self-love. You place the oxygen mask
on yourself first before helping others.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Here
are a few ways to implement more self-care and self-love into your
life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Self-love
means taking care of your body.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
take care of our bodies, so we’ll feel good and live a long time!
This means eating and drinking healthy and being educated and
intentional about what you are putting in your body as fuel. It means
moving your body. Our bodies are made to move, and your health will
plummet if you are too sedentary. Exercise is also an excellent way
to manage stress and anxiety.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Self-care
involves seeking out healthcare professionals when things aren’t
feeling right or going well, and not waiting too long to do it.  It
means flossing and going to the dentist so you can keep your teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Self-care
also includes sleep. Your body (and your mind) need sleep! When you
sleep your body heals itself, rejuvenates, processes experiences and
emotions. I know this can be difficult during certain times of your
life, for instance when you have young babies or tight deadlines!
Just keep this in mind when you start feeling irritable or down and
recognize trying to squeeze in some extra zzzz’s might be just what
you need to take care of yourself. Paddy and I were good at taking
turns getting up with the kids when they were little and taking turns
sleeping in on the weekends. It can make a huge difference in your
relationship!</P>

<B>Self-love means taking care of your mind and your spirit.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">What
do you love? What activities light you up, exhilarate you, or make
you excited? What would you do right now if you could do anything in
the world?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Doing
things that bring you joy is critical to self-love. It feeds your
mind and your spirit. There were a few years there where, when we had
free time, I would let everyone in my family decide what we would do.
Paddy loves sports so I’d end up at a tailgate and a football game.
The kids love going out to eat, movies, and they both like bowling,
so those were often family activities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Then
there are the things that I do for myself. I love being
outdoors—hiking, skiing, camping. I love writing songs and playing
music. I love dancing. I make time for the things that bring me joy.
When I light up from doing something I love it’s contagious and
tends to spread and light up the people around me. I show up in the
world the way I want the world to show up for me: enthusiastic,
excited, joyful. And when you show up that way, your expressions of
love for other people are more easily seen and felt. Try it. You’ll
see what I’m talking about. You wouldn’t deny the people you love
doing the things that bring them joy, so don’t deny yourself that
privilege either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Without
getting too religious or preachy, engaging in spiritual practice is a
part of self-love too. Allowing, growing, or pursuing a connection to
something larger than yourself can feed your soul, bring you peace,
reduce your stress—all of which enable you to bring a better self
to any relationship. I’m not religious, but I do have a spiritual
practice and I meditate every day. It carries not only a spiritual
benefit but also focus, clarity, and improved brainwave activity.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Fostering
self-love as an emotion is hard work but will likely show the most
immediate results in your relationships.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Our
ability to love anyone or anything, including ourselves, lies in our
ability to focus on and appreciate all of the good stuff, accept the
flaws, and forgive the mistakes. Learn to do this for yourself, and
you can do it for your partner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Squash
self-criticismPractice self-compassion.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Self-compassion
is the opposite of self-criticism. Self-compassion accepts you are
imperfect and in action it means you stop judging yourself and start
being nice to yourself. It involves treating yourself with kindness
and caring when you make mistakes, fail, or are going through a rough
time instead of criticizing and beating yourself up over them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">As
I mentioned earlier, I used to spend quite a bit of time beating
myself up for my mistakes. I would think about the mistake and turn
it all around in my mind as a type of “post-mortem” while
criticizing myself for being so dumb, naïve, lazy, or any number of
negative qualities I may have displayed at the time of making the
error. I would relive those moments over and over again in my mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">How
do you think I felt about myself while I relived my mistakes in my
head and called myself all of those negative things? Good? Happy?
Ready to take on the world? Of course not. It was more like
self-loathing and wondering how I managed to do anything well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
used to let my mind go wherever it wanted, think whatever it wanted
and believe every all of my thoughts. Don’t fall into the trap of
believing all your own thoughts. Just because you have them doesn’t
make them real. You get to choose if they are true or not. “I made
a big mistake” is a truth, because we all make big mistakes. “I
am shit because of the big mistake I made” is a judgement and not
true unless you decide it’s true.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_Hlk482277888"></A>
It’s far more useful to ask, “Does that thought serve me and help
me become my best and highest self? Or does that thought bring me
down?” How about, “Would I ever say this to my child? Or my best
friend?” If the answer is no, these are the thoughts you need to
start becoming aware ofweeding out. Paddy talks about this as
negative self-talk. We both agree: Part of self-love is listening to
what you are saying to yourself and practicing self-compassion for
having unkind thoughts, recognizing we ALL have them, and be kind and
gentle to yourself.start shutting down the nasty shit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Unfortunately,
this is easier said than done. You need to become more aware of your
thoughts—that internal dialogue we all have in our heads.
Meditation can be useful to train you to hear them and particularly a
mindfulness practice. I like Unified Mindfulness<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
because it takes a more scientific approach. It takes a little time
to understand the technique and some practice but luckily just ten
minutes a day for a few months can bring you closer, faster. Being
aware of unkind thoughts without buying into them or trying to make
them go away, helps you stay focused on what really matters.

I took an online spirituality class called <I>A Spirit-Led Life </I>from
an amazing human being named Jenai Lane<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
who has deepened my understanding of many of the principles we
discuss in this book.  In this class, we were asked to identify our
“integrity holes,” places where we were not in integrity with
ourselves. These are the activities, thoughts, feelings that take the
wind out of your sail and drain your energy. My negative self-talk
and self-criticism were at the top of my list.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
exercise started out simply enough: I identified the negative
self-talk and self-criticism as my integrity holes, and acknowledged
that I had a tendency to judge myself critically. The next steps got
a little hairier. After recognition came labeling, taking a moment to
call a critical or judgmental thought what it is, then we had to “let
it go,” releasing that negativity through a quick meditation and
forgiving myself for having these thoughts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
set the intention to start this new activity the next morning. I get
up around 5:00 AM and I start my workout at 6:15 00 most mornings,
and I couldn’t believe it when I counted over twenty critical and
judgmental thoughts between when the alarm went off and when it was
time to exercise! I undoubtedly would have had many more, but it took
a considerable amount of time to stop, label, “let go,” and
forgive myself in between each of these thoughts! I had to slow my
critical roll if I was going to get anything done that day.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
The technique isn’t designed to get rid of all of your negativity -
this is impossible. Negativity is part of our humanity. Instead it’s
meant to start reprogramming your tendency to buy-into and believe
the negativity and to then practice some self-compassion. What is
amazing is that it did actually significantly reduce my negative
thoughts!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">After
practicing this technique for only a few days, I went from
approximately one negative thought every two minutes to less than one
an hour. Not too shabby.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
next step was to try to trade outfollow-up my few remaining negative
thoughts with something more … gentle? Inspiring? <I>Self-loving</I>.
These ended up being on-the-fly affirmations of sorts. I tried to
think of what I might say to my children. FSo for example, one of my
negative thoughts today was, “I can’t believe I didn’t get up
at 5:00 and skipped my workout. I’m so lazy and clearly not
dedicated enough.” Ouch. When I caught myself thinking these
things, I quickly countered that up with, “No one is perfect. I’m
disappointed I didn’t get up early today. It’s ok to feel
disappointed and it’s ok I didn’t get up early today. “But 
I’ll be up at 5:00 tomorrow to get back on track!” Better right?
These are habits you develop over time, with practice, not quick
fixes that will happen overnight.<BR><B>If your compassion does not
include yourself, it is incomplete. -Buddha</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%; page-break-before: always">
<B>Self-appreciation is self-love.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">To
achieve a higher level of self-love, I also spend a few minutes every
morning making a list of things I’m grateful for and love about
myself. When I started doing this, it was torture. I would sit there
for thirty minutes or more. Sometimes really trying to think of
things but mostly distracting myself with other thoughts or
fidgeting. I guess it was difficult because I’d never really given
it much thought but also because it felt like conceit or bragging. It
felt like engaging in an activity which was the opposite of humility.
It felt like by doing this I could turn myself into a narcissist.
Sometimes this still happens, but I have pages and pages now of
things I love and appreciate about myself I can refer back to in a
pinch.However, the more I did it, the more I realized this was not
about conceit, it was about self-acceptance and being not only
comfortable but happy in my own skin. It was about counteracting all
of the damaging thoughts and criticisms I poison myself with – not
on purpose but because it is our nature to ruminate on the negative.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
also realized that many if not all of the things I was grateful for
about myself were things humans have in common, which turned this
list into gratitude not just for myself, but for humanity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">So
what does this look like? I often start at the very most basic level.
I’m grateful to be alive, to have the experience of living life as
a human on the earth. So I translate that gratitude to something I’m
grateful for about myself:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<I>I love my soul that allows me life—for that spark that started
my heart beating and my lungs to breathing. I love my body and all of
its senses that enable me to experience life and the world. I love my
mind that organizes all the information it receives. I love my
curiosity that has allowed me to learn all I know.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">And
you could go on and on with those, but then when I’m making my list
I usually try to think of what I have going on that day and what I
might need to accomplish and then I try to kind of pump myself up
about those things. I write and record music, so if those are the
activities I’m going to be doing that day, some of my self-love
lists say things like:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<I>I love my creativity that brings the music. I love that my ability
to learn new things has allowed me to become a recording engineer.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">You
get the idea. Think of this in terms of your gifts, the things you
were given when you were born. I was generalizing with “my body,”
but you could say, “my eyes with 20/20 vision,” or, “my singing
voice,” or any number of other things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Where
is your focus?</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">What
you focus on grows. If you keep your attention on all of the negative
things about yourself, those things get bigger. If you concentrate on
the amazing things about yourself, you’ll notice those things also
grow bigger, if even only in your own heart and mind. The good news
is that this is really the only place that it matters anyhow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>You</B><B>
practice self-love </B><B>to learn how to love others better.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">A
friend once told me he had no idea how anyone could stay in a
relationship, running down a thorough list of every negative thing
from his most recent love affair to prove his point. He talked about
his ex’s flaws, personality and physical, and their annoying habits
and quirks. I listened for quite some time, doing my best to keep
from criticizing or judging him for his criticisms and judgments. I
said instead:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">“You
know, Paddy is growing more and more hair as we get older, especially
in places like his ears. And he’s always been gassy, except when we
were dating of course. And he chews his nails. And all of his
household projects take at least twice as long as he says they will.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">“BUT,”
I added, “instead of focusing on those things, I choose to focus on
his mesmerizing blue-green eyes that change colors depending on what
he is wearing; on the fact that he is one of the most generous men I
know; how he can fix anything, and how he gives the very best hugs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Listen,
we all have flaws. We all make mistakes. We all have our shit. IF you
practice taking care of yourself, so you feel your best; IF you
practice self-compassion; IF you forgive your mistakes and flaws
while reminding yourself of all of the amazing things about yourself;
IF you treat these things as a practice and not a destination, you
will feel the ripples of those changes to yourself emanate through
all of your relationships. It is the most difficult thing for us to
learn to extend ourselves these courtesies, but once we have done
that, it is simple to extend them to everyone else. IF you do these
things, I guarantee you will be a happier, better version of
yourself. I would also bet your relationship will also reap the
benefits of these changes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Self-love,
just like all love, is more than a mere emotion. It is a practice.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<B>HE SAID: Love yourself? What the…</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">It
has been repeated to me over and over that, “You must first love
yourself before you can become the best you possible.” For most of
my life, I have not really understood this principle. In the last
chapter, I talked about insecurity as something that I struggled with
earlier in our relationship and life and how that insecurity
manifested itself. Looking back, I can see many other places
insecurity popped up in my life and relationships. Insecurity, in my
opinion, is the antithesis of loving oneself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Well
there you have it, my part is done. Don’t be insecure, love
yourself, it’s that simple. Got it?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
wish it were that simple, but it’s not, and I have to try to convey
this point no matter how uncomfortable it is to do. Why is it
uncomfortable? Because I am still a work in progress with this whole
love yourself thing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">In
today’s media-infused society, loving yourself completely is
fucking hard if not impossible. As men, we are constantly bombarded
with various dick measuring contests everywhere we look. If you turn
off ads, someone is junk emailing you about low T, or blue pills,
whiter teeth, or hair growth. Everyone who is selling something is
telling us that we are not good enough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
message is clear: You’re only good or successful if someone else
thinks you are. The hot young girl slows her walk to stop, slowly
turns her head and smiles seductively at the man with the new car
rolling by. These messages condition us to believe that everything is
validated by the opinions of others, how many “likes” or “shares”
you get. None of this has anything to do with self-love; it has
everything to do with insecurity. Loving yourself can be an uphill
battle when the rest of society is incessantly preying on your
insecurity that you are not good enough unless…</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<B>SHE SAID:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Ahem
… you really think you men have it hard with the media? Women have
to have bubble butts, big tits, small waists, muscular but not too
bulky legs, and we are absolutely not allowed to age or risk becoming
irrelevant, where old men like Sean Connery are still sexy. Oh, and
we also have to play the bimbo who is acting like the guy is somehow
hot because of the car. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<B>Enough whining, back to HE SAID:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Men,
in general, are supposed to be—say it with me guys: Strong,
Confident, Decisive, Successful, Hunters, Heroes. I am puffing my
chest out and growling a bit right now just writing these things.
Grrrrrr I am MAN!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Bullshit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
am Patrick.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
have to start there. That is the beginning of getting on track to
self-loving.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">For
me, there is always a little voice inside me saying I can do better.
I think that voice is necessary, but I have grown to realize that I
also need to be able to recognize when it is full of shit. Sometimes
that voice is a product of the conditioned belief that I am not good
enough, or that I won’t be happy unless I have or do something
else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
am getting way better at recognizing that voice and eliminating it.
But it is not easy. For example, I thought it would be cool to have a
Sprinter camper van. If it was diesel, got decent mileage and was in
my budget, I might want one for exploring the US. So I went to
RVT.com and looked at used Sprinter vans for thirty minutes. Nothing.
Okay, I don’t need one to be happy because what I wanted didn’t
exist. Tell that to Google. I have been bombarded with ads about
Sprinter vans for the last six weeks. It is incessant. These ads are
really trying to condition me that I need one to be happy. It’s a
benign example, but it should illustrate the point of the constant
bombardment by media with the sole purpose of influencing our
thinking. So turn it off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
have always had an answer to the question, “What do you love most
about yourself?” but there’s a big difference between being able
to describe your better qualities and showing yourself love. At my
core, I had been so unsatisfied with who I was, and the soundtrack
playing between my ears reflected that. I was very hard on myself and
rarely used kind words when looking in the mirror. Here is an example
of my past usual self-talk: “I procrastinate. I need to lose
fifteen pounds. I’m starting to look fat. I suck at meditating. I
suck at consistent exercise. I should not be eating this food that is
so bad for me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Recently
I had a moment of clarity. It came when I saw the gap between how I
let others see me—a funny, life of the party, genuine person, who
really cares about people—and how I saw myself. I recognized that
underneath those veneers, was a guy who constantly told himself he
wasn’t good enough. Underneath was a guy who usually used humor to
deflect the real questions he didn’t want to answer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">That
moment of clarity was fueled by spending two weeks on a bucket list
adventure in Vietnam with GoBundance, a mastermind group I belong to.
We had come together for deep conversation and to ask and answer some
really tough questions, all with the goal of pushing each other to
become better, more balanced men. I was talking about our book and
quoted Sam by saying, “The first person you need to love in a
relationship is yourself. You can’t love others completely until
you do that.” I guess by posing the topic, I set myself up to have
to answer it first. “Patrick, do you really love yourself?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">My
response was, “Can you be more specific?” Then, when the
chuckling subsided, I said, “Oh most definitely. In fact, I loved
myself this morning—that’s why there is an empty box of Kleenex
and a bottle of Jergens next to the bed.” Deflect. Deflect again.
Then one more deflection for good measure. I then sighed and added,
“You know I am not sure …” But before my moment of
vulnerability could set in, I threw in one last self-protective
deflection: “It’s a good thing Sam is writing that chapter in our
book!” Funny? I thought so, which is probably why I laughed harder
than everyone else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">After
I made my jokes and successfully deflected, I paused, and then I just
sat there. I realized I could not answer the question. At that
moment, I knew I did not accept myself completely. Therefore I did
not love myself completely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">In
addition to asking each other tough questions, the men of GoBundance
get up in front of each other and talk about important aspects of our
lives. We expose our flaws and desires to improve. We tell one
another what we need the most help with and where we need
accountability. I listened to several people say “my relationship”
or “my exercise and nutrition.” I joined the chorus and cited
exercise and diet as the things I needed the most help with, too.
Deflect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Then
came, “What do you love most about yourself?” I again listened to
each person’s answer before giving my own, saying, “I love my
everyday desire to improve as a man.” Bullshit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Later
on the trip (the exact moment of clarity) I sat at a table discussing
self-love with another member of our tribe, and I realized the
hypocrisy AND the simplicity of the whole topic. The hypocrisy was
how we had accepted each other’s answers to the question over and
over again when it was clear that they were facades. And I was right
at the forefront. The simplicity was that it ALL stemmed from the
same source. Weight, exercise, relationship problems,
procrastination—no matter the “topic,” they all related to the
exact same thing: a lack of self-love.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
question is not “What do you love most about yourself?” which can
easily be answered with a shiny coat of gloss, leaving the foundation
of the problem rotting away. The question—the ONLY question—should
be, “Do you love yourself?” If I loved myself, would I take
better care of myself? If I loved myself, would I do what I said,
especially if I’d only made that promise to myself?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Here
is the real mind blowing part. When I do not love myself (e.g., don’t
work out, eat junk, put things off, waste time, or don’t show
gratitude for my wife’s love) I start a vicious cycle of
self-deprecation. I am fat; I am a procrastinator; I don’t deserve
Sam’s love. These are all thoughts that adversely contradict
self-love. These have been my thoughts and triggers for years and
years. These are insecurities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
biggest takeaway for me on all of this is that I KNOW if I can master
the ability to truly love myself, I will be:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">1.
A better father,</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">2.
A better husband, and</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">3.
A better man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
will be these things because I will no longer be telling myself
behind the curtain that I’m a fraud, which I know affects my mood
and my demeanor towards those around me in a negative way. In fact, I
will remove the curtain and scrape away the veneer for good, because
it no longer serves a purpose for me. That is my mantra. The outcome
will be what I become. And no matter what, it will be enough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Self-love
requires you to engage more and more in loving behaviors, eliminating
the insecurities that make you question whether you are good enough
and replacing the negative self-talk with messages of forgiveness and
acceptance. Ask yourself, “Am I taking care of myself, nurturing
myself and giving myself what I need to flourish and thrive?”
Self-love means discovering what drives you and makes you sing, then
doing that every day. It is not giving a shit about what anyone
thinks. It is about just being you, being authentic. Self-love
doesn’t care what society’s definitions are of your gender or
race or how you should look or act. Self-love is taking care of you
no matter what. It is stepping back with a sigh of satisfaction and
bliss knowing that now you are ready to love everyone else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Everyone
is different when it comes to the specifics. You may even feel that
self-love is a place where you already excel, and you don’t need
any more work on the subject. Awesome. I am not there yet, but
endeavor to keep progressing. One of the tools I have used has been
reproduced in a worksheet in the back of the book (The Self-Love
Worksheet) that asks some tough questions and may help fast-track you
to understanding the concept better.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<B>THEY SAY:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Researchers
do not come out and say ‘Self-love is critical to your happiness as
a human and also to the success of your relationships.’ HOWEVER,
there is a ton of research out there supporting exactly what we’re
saying here. We lump a whole slew of different activities, thoughts,
and emotions together and call it ‘self-love.’ Scientists don’t
like lumping - it’s imprecise. They break it down:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Self-Care:</B>
There has been a ton of research done regarding the benefits of
self-care. You can read all about the benefits of sleep, exercise,
and healthy eating as bringing about greater levels of mental and
physical well-being as well as longevity.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
There also happens to be a significant body of research displaying
the positive effects of self-care on relationships directly! For
example, there are multiple studies showing the positive effects of
exercise on relationships - especially with regards to sexual
performance and satisfaction.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
There are other studies linking sleep and relationship satisfaction.
Turns out when you don’t get enough sleep you may be more irritable
and unable to think clearly which may lead to less-than-optimal
interactions with your partner (Duh!). Also, people in happy
relationships consistently report they enjoy better sleep.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Self-Compassion:</B>
The study of self-compassion is relatively new in psychology emerging
as part of positive psychology which really only started to gain
considerable headway at the turn of this century in the late 1990’s.
The majority of the research in self-compassion has been spearheaded
by Kristin Neff. She literally wrote the book on self-compassion<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="#sdfootnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
where she reports the findings of a decade of research on the many
benefits of self-compassion. Turns out it is not only good for the
individual, the benefits also extend to romantic relationships.
Self-compassionate people tend to be more caring, accepting, and
supporting of their partners.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote10anc" HREF="#sdfootnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Self-compassion
is also slowly gaining momentum as a more positive alternative to
self-esteem.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
Self-esteem, popularized in the 1970’s as an extremely important
part of a person’s psyche and correlated to higher performance,
better habits, better socializing, and better relationships, after
decades of research has not proven to be the golden linchpin once
imagined.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote12anc" HREF="#sdfootnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
High self-esteem appears to be correlated with as many pitfalls as
benefits including narcissism, conceit, and bullying. High
self-esteem is also related to defensiveness. Defensiveness is cited
by Dr. John Gottman, a well renowned psychologist known for his
forty-plus years of research of marriage stability and divorce, as
one of the predictors of divorce.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Self-Appreciation:</B>
Later in the book we’ll discuss gratitude as a topic and we’ll
highlight the many, many scientifically proven benefits of expressing
gratitude. Self-appreciation is certainly a form of gratitude and
also carries with it those same benefits. However, there appears to
be little research regarding self-appreciation separate from
gratitude in general but separate from self-esteem.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Neff
offers a compelling perspective on self-appreciation in her book
about self-compassion. She quotes William James, an American
psychologist and philosopher, “The deepest principle of human
nature is a craving to be appreciated.” Neff points out the
problematic nature of that urge in that it requires someone else to
fulfill the need, unless of course you can develop the skill of
self-appreciation. She juxtaposes self-appreciation to self-esteem by
stating self-esteem requires comparison of oneself to others whereas
self-appreciation is an objective evaluation of oneself and
acknowledgment of the positive aspects. She also states self-esteem
tends to highlight the differences between people but
self-appreciation displays the commonality amongst people.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Reducing
Negative Self-Talk:</B> There are many studies supporting the
prevalence of negativity in our everyday self-talk. According to one
study, sixty to seventy percent of our sub-conscious self-talk, our
‘mental chatter,’ is negative.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote14anc" HREF="#sdfootnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
Another study showed even our conscious thoughts tend towards the
negative as a survival mechanism which is referred to as the
‘negativity bias.’<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote15anc" HREF="#sdfootnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
The best strategy to combat negative self-talk? Learning to foster
positivity by practicing positive thinking. This will lead to
self-talk which includes ‘less self-criticism and more
self-acceptance’ and leads to the following benefits<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote16anc" HREF="#sdfootnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A>:</P>

you’ve never studied a new language, you should try it! Learning a
different language is also learning a new way of looking at the
world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Depending
on whom you ask there are as many as eight different words for types
of love in ancient Greek. The more Paddy and I learn about these
words, the more they make sense to us—much more so than the very
confusing word “love.” We use the same word to express a feeling
we have for our parents as we do for our lovers, for our children and
our country—not to mention food or cars or outfits. To feel each of
these emotions, with all of their complexity, is to know they are not
the same. And so the question begs: Can we truly understand love if
the language we use to define it falls short?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Our
eyes were further opened when we attended a workshop with a highly
regarded Peruvian Shaman who proclaimed very bluntly that we as
humans know nothing about love. Jesus came to the earth to teach us
about love, he explained, but we missed the message. And when you
consider that the average person is likely to say “I love pizza”
as readily as “I love you,” the Shaman has a point. Given the
current state of marriages and the world, we tend to agree with him.
But we can change that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">To
better understand love, we’ve got to expand our vocabulary.
Learning the Greek names for love will give us the opportunity to
explore its different types with more clarity, so let’s define some
of these in simplified terms<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
and then continue to use them throughout this book.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><I><B>Eros:
Sexual PassionIn Love</B></I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Named
after the Greek god of fertility, Eros is the erotic, passionate, or
sexual love you likely felt for your partner when you first met or
when you first realized you wanted to be romantic with someone. This
is the “madly in love” stage our society seems to be obsessed
with. All “chick flicks” or romantic comedies are about this kind
of love, the yearning, the fire, the keep-you-up-at-night,
all-consuming love that takes hold of your entire being. It’s the
<I>Twilight</I> series, the Nicholas Sparks titles sprinkled across
the best-seller list. Eros love is the love that possesses you.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Our
society places an extraordinarily high value on Eros love. We want to
get it, and then we expect those feelings to last. However, the
Greeks did not hold this kind of love in such high regard. They
viewed Eros as out of control, irrational, and dangerous like
wildfire. We would add that Eros is like all extremes, unsustainable.
If you continue to seek only this kind of love, you will always be
searching for new partners with whom you can get back to this “high.”
Doing so comes at a cost, though. Chasing Eros will ultimately
prevent you from experiencing the other types of deeper love with a
life partner.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Philia
is the love you feel for very close friends or siblings. It is the
love where you confide in people, where you share trust, where you
have sacrificed for one another, and feel a sense of loyalty. The
Greeks considered Philia one of the least natural loves because it
isn’t required for reproduction, but can you imagine your life or
relationship without it? We choose this type of love as humans. We
even name cities after it!<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote18anc" HREF="#sdfootnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#252525"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Storgē</SPAN></FONT>
is familial love most exemplified by the love between children and
parents. It is a love that happens naturally without effort and
without regard to whether the object of that love is “worthy” of
love. <FONT COLOR="#252525"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Storgē</SPAN></FONT>
is love without discrimination. It is affectionate but not sexual.

Playful Love</B></I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Ludus
is a playful kind of love. Ludus is flirtatious and might include
teasing and playing pranks on one another. You might go dancing, play
sports together, enjoy the outdoors. This kind of love is more casual
and frivolous than the others. It’s no surprise then that Ludus is
often described as activities of “young love.”</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
will talk about self-love again and again and again in this book
because we believe it is critical to happiness and building deep,
loving relationships. There are however two kinds of self-love. There
is narcissism, the type of self-obsession that cannot exist in
healthy, loving relationships, and then there is the self-love that
is caring about and taking responsibility for oneself. Guess which
one we’re here to talk about.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">In
our society, we’re taught to put everyone else first. (We think
this is particularly the case for women!) We’re here to tell you,
if you don’t learn to take care of and love yourself, you risk
burnout, physical and emotional health issues, resentment, feeling
like a victim of your life, or even a martyr. And none of those will
help or feed any of your relationships. We believe learning
self-compassion is the only way you can have genuine and sincere
compassion for others. We need to stop judging and being
self-critical and extend ourselves compassion as well as forgiveness
when we make mistakes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">It’s
amazing, we promise, but depending on your personality and how you
were raised, self-love can be extremely difficult. The effort is
worth it, however. As we discussed in the last chapter, once we learn
to do this for ourselves, it becomes easier and natural to extend
this same kind of love to everyone else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><I><B>Agape:
Unconditional and All-Inclusive Love</B></I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Agape
is described as selfless love, “God love,” or charitable love. It
loves without conditions, regardless of changing circumstances and it
is one thing that appears in all world religions in some form or
fashion. It described as love for everyone, gift love, or universal
loving-kindness. We believe this is the love Jesus spent his time on
earth trying to teach us. Agape is empathetic, patient,
understanding, kind, faithful, forgiving and giving. It isn’t
critical. It doesn’t judge. It recognizes that we are all
connected. This love is conditional in only one respect: You cannot
achieve it without loving yourself the same way.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%; page-break-before: always">
And finally, we come to long-lasting love, the north star of your
Bigger Love:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><I><B>Pragma:
Truly Loving</B></I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Pragma
is defined by some as “pragmatic love,” meaning a practical love
or love of convenience, and it could be used to describe the love
that evolves from arranged marriages that never started with romantic
love. We believe it is also the love you have to work for to evolve
your partnership to the “true love” that will last your lifetime.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Pragma
is about compromise, patience, intention, attention, intimacy, space,
tolerance, and a whole slew of paradoxical thoughts, emotions,
actions, and reactions. It is an elaborate and highly satisfying
dance. We believe learning to love in Pragma and Agape love are the
meaning of life—that is how amazing, uplifting, and transcendent
these kinds of love can be!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Pragma’s
literal translation means “an action.” And <I>action</I> is
exactly what the entirety of this book is about. You have to take
action to experience what we call Truly Loving. You have to endeavor
to achieve it. Truly Loving is not some magical, elusive, exclusive
emotion; it is something you earn by striving to have it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">All
of the types of love are so interconnected that most modern languages
lump them all into that one word—love. Even the modern Greeks don’t
regularly use all of these words for love. It is likely you can
recognize aspects of each of them in many of your relationships.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Long-term
friendships, for example, include PhiliaPhilia (Friendship Love) but
usually also a little LudusLudus (Friendship Love), and if you’ve
been friends long enough, you will have granted some AgapeAgape
(Unconditional Love) love because your friendship would have to be
strong enough to weather some storms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">In
romantic relationships, as an example, many couples start out as
friends—PhiliaPhilia (Friendship Love). Friends often spend time
together doing fun things like going out to eat, singing karaoke, or
bowling—this would be playful, flirting Ludus (Playful Love).
Things start heating up, and now there is also some physical
attraction—moving into the Eros (In Love) type of love. One partner
falls ill, and the other comes to their aid, taking care of them and
nursing them back to health—this would be a time where it has
shifted to <FONT COLOR="#252525"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">StorgēStorgē
(Love Between Children &amp; Parents)</SPAN></FONT> love.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">One
partner makes a big mistake in the relationship—maybe they lie,
have some indiscretion, or let their temper get the best of them at
an inopportune moment—but the other partner continues to love them
anyhow, granting them empathy, compassion, and forgiveness. This
would require some level of PhilautiaPhilautia (Self-Love) because
the forgiving partner would need to feel secure enough in their own
skin to understand the actions of their partner are not a reflection
of themselves. It would also be an act of AgapeAgape (Unconditional
Love) love in that the forgiving partner is required to reserve
judgment and criticism in order to show empathy and compassion.
Finally, this would also be one step on the road to Pragma because
the forgiving partner has provided the space to their partner to make
mistakes, providing the receiving partner a taste of unconditional
love. It is a very comforting and secure feeling to know you are
still lovable regardless of your mistakes and your shortcomings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Even
though there are aspects of each of these types of love in all of our
relationships, each relationship will have a <I>primary</I> type of
love, which can be helpful to identify.</P>

<B>HE SAID: The migration and why it won’t </B><I><B>always</B></I><B>
be like this</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Being
in love is awesome. There is a newfound need in your life that
consumes all others. This need comes with a feeling of helplessness,
gut-wrenching butterflies, and an ignorant bliss that makes it all
feel so incredible. Most times being “in love” evolves into
knowing you have found “The One.” That knowledge then takes you
to an even higher level of unique euphoria. It is an incredible
feeling like no other you will have in your lifetime. Of course,
there are still the rigors, responsibilities, and tasks of ordinary
daily life, but they all seem secondary and somewhat superficial in
comparison. When you are deep in ErosEros (In Love), it is
everything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Well,
that’s what it was like for me anyway. Some days, I felt reduced to
nothing more than a grown man stumbling through life like a lovesick
teenager. Why that analogy stopped at “teenager,” I have not been
able to figure out; “lovesick” always applied to me no matter
what my age.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">One
must be careful not to get completely lost in love, however; it is
easy sometimes to portray yourself as someone you are not while
keeping her on a bit of a pedestal. You accept your partner for all
her flaws in the beginning. You might even think some of them are
cute and endearing. She can do no wrong! At the same time, you’re
trying to present yourself as flawless as possible. Some of your
“quirks” may not be on display when you are around her, and some
of your interests may be easily diverted. “No, I would much rather
go with you to the still-life exhibition at the art gallery than
watch football with my friends. Culture is important to me, and we
can learn so much from the color palette of well-positioned fruit!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Never
mind the fact that you’ll later make an excuse to step outside to
fart unnoticed and call your buddies to bail on College Gameday. The
truth is you love football and have no intention of replacing it with
gallery strolls for the rest of your life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Don’t
get me wrong, being in love is awesome and should not be diminished
in any way. I am just pointing out that sometimes we become a bit
less authentic, telling ourselves a story about how we may need to
behave so as not to lose this “keeper” who has come into our
life. This inauthenticity is simply a form of insecurity that is
fueled by a fear of rejection. That fear cannot exist inside a person
who loves himself. It is common, and I speak from experience. Both in
my own behavior and that of people I have been in a relationship
with. I am not perfect yet; I know you keep waiting for me to get
there but it likely won’t happen in this book.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">So
first things first, let’s recognize we are being insecure and,
after the third gallery stroll, get back to authenticity and casually
mention that you prefer to watch college football on Saturday (and
that it was you who crop-dusted the Van Gogh display.). Authenticity
is sexy, and you shouldn’t have an issue, but with all
relationships there comes compromise. You will likely have some
tradeoff with interests. The good news is that you will no longer be
misrepresenting yourself as a non-gaseous art lover.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Another
tendency, in the beginning, is to lose the ability to make a decision
and mirror your happiness in theirs. “What do you want?” “That’s
what I want!” “You are so amazing,” “It’s like we’re
connected on so many levels.” Romance is hidden around every
corner, and you pull out all stops to make sure that you succeed in
the love department.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
start out like the peacock during the mating ritual, our feathers and
confidence are on full display as we strut to the front to win their
affection. But once we win the prize, our feathers tuck back in and
our stride becomes less flamboyant. And we have succumbed to the
normality that sometimes can leave much of the romance in its wake.
We stopped prioritizing the relationship as “What You Want, I Want”
and slowly start diverting to “What I expect from You Is …”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Sex
is a great example of what I’m talking about here. Sex is usually
not an issue in a new relationship; it is spectacular, new, and
uninhibited. Gladly trying new things and intently focused on
pleasing each other. Then later in the relationship, people tend to
become more selfish, more inhibited, less willing and sometimes
refusing to be playful altogether. Many, many couples end up in some
variation of this. I won’t say it is normal, just that it is not
unusual. And to “bring back that loving feeling,” we need to stop
the pattern of thinking that chased it away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">“<B>The
Migration is in full swing or happened years ago</B><B>,</B><B> and
we are stuck.” So what now?</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">First
off we need to remind ourselves: “I love this person.” Ingrain
that message in your brain and constantly be mindful of it. Only then
can it translate into action. A good way to do that is to ask
yourself: “Are my words and actions consistently loving?” and
then modify accordingly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">For
example, have you ever had to sit and listen to a couple say mean and
nasty things to each other? Have you ever engaged in that behavior?
Speaking like that to each other is not loving in any way. Would you
ever have talked to each other like that at the beginning of your
relationship? I will answer that with a resounding NO! So why would
you do it now? Why say unloving things? The book <I>Crucial
Conversations<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote19anc" HREF="#sdfootnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A></I>
will say it is because we ourselves are hurt, and we will dive deeper
into that idea later. The important thing is to recognize the
behavior, catch yourself quickly, and remember to be loving instead.
Being in love is easy. Being loving all the time takes work. It
requires a different mindset, and you won’t have the aid of the
blind euphoria of new love.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">There
are hacks to this, however. My friend Cassidy says “making out”
with his wife of fourteen years keeps the romance high. He is
obviously not in the beginning stages of ErosEros (In Love) anymore,
but he swears by it. I quietly thought “Well maybe that works for
you, but …” Then I looked it up and found an article by Elizabeth
Weiss McGolerick<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote20anc" HREF="#sdfootnote20sym"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
supporting Cassidy’s claims. The article states that kissing
stimulates secretion of oxytocin, which is a neuropeptide that, among
other things, helps you feel trust, empathy, closeness, and increases
sexual arousal. Whoa! So there you have it, Cassidy was right. It may
not be new love euphoria, but it sounds pretty good to me and is
certainly more sustainable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
have another friend, Ryan, who is madly in love, and while he is not
quite as lost as our non-gaseous art lover (as most people are not)
he has made some adjustments to his routine that resulted in some
negative self-talk. Ironically, this is the same friend who I spoke
with for hours in Vietnam about self-love. He is as evolved as anyone
on the concept but as vulnerable as the rest of us in practice. That
is perfectly fine. No one reading this book, or any book for that
matter, can claim perfection when it comes to self-love. Success is
recognition and modification.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Back
to Ryan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">“She
has become my center of focus,” he told me, “and I have let some
of my routines slip considerably. She and our impending engagement
have been the most important thing to me. Everything else seems to
have fallen by the wayside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">“Dude,”
I said. “You see what you are doing, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Then
he said, “Well it’s not that I am doing things I don’t want to
do. I am still happy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
responded, “I get that, but you yourself told me that self-love
sometimes requires triage. You recognize something’s missing so
take steps to do those certain things, the ones that you’ve put on
the back burner, the ones that are gnawing at you right now and help
you love yourself completely. Just correct it right now. It’s that
easy”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
recognize that in a new relationship what is the most important
sometimes gets cloudy. And even if you are like Ryan and understand
self-love, sometimes you can get sidetracked and not even notice. But
when the love drug begins to wear off, you may start to harbor
resentment. Remember, though, that it is ultimately your decision to
prioritize the important pieces of your life and thus it’s your
responsibility to line them up accordingly in order of importance
(triage).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
mentioned new love, mad love, euphoria and the love drug above. Let
me explain what I mean. The reason we equate ErosEros (In Love) to a
drug is that being newly in love can have a similar impact on your
brain. The euphoria you feel when in love is caused by endorphins and
hormones—most notably dopamine, the same hormone intensified by
cocaine.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote21anc" HREF="#sdfootnote21sym"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
When we are “madly in love” (Eros) we can become addicted to that
high and strive to feel it always. When that happens, we may let
other important things slip. These things happen; sometimes they are
necessary, but we need to be mindful of the big picture and continue
to take care of ourselves, to love ourselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Ryan
was getting inconsistent with his regular exercise and meditation,
usually morning rituals that helped him be much more balanced. By
skipping those, he realized he was knocking his brain and body out of
whack and getting down on himself for it. All I had to do was remind
him that being the best version of himself was how he would bring his
A-game to the relationship. By allowing the love drug to compromise
that, he was creating a situation where he might start to build
resentment when the euphoric high wears off. He realized immediately
that by helping himself in this scenario he would strengthen the
relationship over the long term, and that was all he wanted. He is a
pretty smart dude.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
believe Sam and I exemplify Pragma love and we have come so much
further than where we began. The butterflies are long gone, as is the
ignorant bliss of being love struck. It took time, it took work, and
it took compromise, but when you really love someone and choose to
spend the rest of your life with them, it’s worth it. That’s why
we are here. Now rather than just being in love, Sam and I have
transitioned to Truly Loving. Truly loving someone means that you
accept him or her for all that they are and focus on the best parts
of that person.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Once
you cross that bridge into Truly Loving, you open the door for a deep
love that becomes an unbreakable bond and defines who you really are.
However, you must first leap a hurdle: When the relationship
transitions out of that euphoric, dopamine-fed state (Eros) to the
long-term, long-lasting love that requires a lot more than feel-good
brain chemicals to sustain it (Pragma). Truly Loving requires
endeavor to flex, improve and grow. This chapter is about recognizing
the difference between the Eros and Pragma and understanding that the
migration has to happen from one to the next. The bulk of this book
is how we describe our journey from Eros to Pragma.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_6dm10so323cj"></A><A NAME="_21jwto6tnxit"></A>
<B>SHE SAID: Love partnerships MUST evolve or they will dissolve</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
you fall madly in love, as Paddy mentions, chemicals are released in
your brain that create a kind of natural high. This high, like all
highs, can be very addicting. You feel good all the time! And who
wouldn’t want that feeling for the rest of their lives? And isn’t
that what the media would have you believe with the giant “Happily
Ever After” at the end of a movie ending in marriage? Aren’t you
supposed to feel madly in love forever?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Honestly,
I thought that. My guess is many people believe this. I thought if I
married the right person I would feel those drug-like highs forever.
All of life would be easier in love, and there would be no such thing
as temptation when I was madly in love. But in my marriage, just like
all of my other relationships, Eros started to wane, and I wasn’t
feeling those drug-like highs of being madly in love as often or
maybe at all. And like any junkie, I started trying to find it again.
I wasn’t just going to let those feelings go without a fight!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
we lived in Kansas City, we put some effort into rekindling those
feelings together, and we had some success. We had some amazing date
nights where sparks would fly! There were some others that were duds.
However, there was a bit of desperation in trying to save Eros
because I didn’t know I couldn’t have that all the time for the
rest of my life. Just knowing that type of love isn’t supposed to
last would have been immensely helpful and might have made the
transition out of Eros easier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">As
things got tougher for Paddy and me, and I had all of that male
attention at my job, I found myself seduced again by Eros as men
flirted with and flattered me. I could get tastes of that Eros high
guilt-free if nothing got physical. I think when I told Paddy we were
done, I was hoping to be swept away by Eros with a new partner. When
that didn’t happen, I had the good fortune of being too busy to
chase Eros. Had I persisted in chasing Eros, I would still be
searching for the madly in love “Happily Ever After” I dreamed
about because doesn’t exist. But worse, I would also never have had
the opportunity to experience real love: Truly Loving.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">You
may still be saying to yourself; I can have that mad love Eros for
the rest of my life! But I’m telling you, you cannot sustain true
Eros as your primary love with your partner for a plethora of
reasons. Eros is the spark that lights the fire and burns fast and
hot. That white-hot flash cannot be the ultimate goal of your
relationship, or you will fail. Your ultimate goal is for your love
to evolve to Pragma and Agape. This is the perfect fire—it just may
be what you came to this earth to do and learn, the meaning of
life—and there is nothing more fulfilling or transcendental than
this love.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Getting
to this type of love and longevity in your partnership takes work.
I’m not going to lie to you, the road between Eros and Pragma is
long and arduous, but as I said, if you put in the work it will bring
you more fulfillment than you ever knew was possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
we were first married, Paddy and I would often comment how we were
the happiest couple we knew. We loved each other’s company; we had
lots of sex; we wanted to be together every moment—we were in Eros.
However, our first year of marriage presented a number of challenges
as we began the Great Migration from Eros to Pragma. It starts as
soon as Eros begins to wane. You’ll know when that happens by how
you feel, and for some, it happens even before marriage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>When
you start to feel yourself desperately trying to fan the dying flames

of those other kinds of love.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
believe working on fostering all of the types of love is time well
spent. And a healthy, loving, long-lasting partnership will require
skills in each of the types of love as your life unfolds. Now that
Eros is waving goodbye, get comfy with the other types of love.
(Don’t panic, Eros will still occasionally show up in different
phases of life with your partner. You just can’t count on this kind
of love—it’s fickle.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
talked all about <B>Philautia</B> (self-love) in the last chapter.
This is crucial to start now no matter where you are in your
relationship and you need to continue until you die and <I>especially</I>
during the Great Migration from Eros to Pragma. Make sure you are
taking care of yourself, and you’ll bring your best self to any
situation that presents itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>LudusLudus
(Friendship Love)</B> is a great one to foster good, loving feelings
towards one another. Play together! Paddy and I have a non-negotiable
weekly date night. Sometimes we stay home and eat popcorn and watch
movies. Sometimes we go out with friends on double-dates or to
parties. Sometimes we go out, get drunk, and come home and have wild
sex. We like to mix it up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
also joke around A LOT. In case you didn’t pick up on it yet, Paddy
is hilarious. He plays little pranks on me, and if I can ever think
of anything, I try to return the favor. He likes to lock me out of
the car and pretend like he is unlocking the door so I jerk the
handle … for minutes at a time. If we’re somewhere busy with lots
of potential onlookers, he will also honk the horn and raise his
hands up as if I’m unable to work a car door handle. He thinks this
is hilarious and it makes everyone around us laugh—and I never mind
being the butt of a joke. It’s a fun time for me. No, really, I
laugh as much as anyone. I think anything that brings laughter is a
fun time, even if people are laughing at me. You’d think this kind
of thing would get old. Maybe we’re totally immature because we
still laugh at this after twenty years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>PhiliaPhilia
(Friendship Love)</B> is another good one to start focusing on during
the migration. All of the other couples we know who have lasted in
their marriages also consider themselves to be best friends. They
tell each other secrets, know exactly what’s going on in each
other’s lives, share their feelings, hopes, desires, and dreams for
the future! Friends build trust with one another over time by keeping
confidences and showing up for each other. And your very best friends
will believe in you even when you may not believe in yourself.
Friends can hear the ugliest truths about you and still love and
support you. If you have a best friend that isn’t your partner,
spend some time thinking about what makes that person your best
friend. What have you done to build that friendship? Try doing those
things with your partner.</P>

few years ago Paddy injured his back. Paddy is a very proud and
independent man who rarely gets sick or injured, and when he does, he
usually refuses any help anyhow. But on this day he was in so much
pain that he couldn’t get out of bed. I called an ambulance and met
him at the hospital. I stayed with him as they gave him some oral
medications to ease the pain. They didn’t seem to have much effect,
and soon they wanted to run an IV. It was a teaching hospital, and
they requested permission for a student to put in the IV. We agreed
but after the fourth or fifth unsuccessful try, my mother lion came
out, and I requested an experienced professional to come and properly
insert the IV.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">They
gave him some drugs through the IV, but after hours of agony, he was
still in pain. Again, my mother lion came out, and I demanded the
doctor come in and do something more. They finally gave him something
that worked, and he fell asleep.</P>

Eros love—the white-hot, fast-burning flame—can’t, doesn’t,
and shouldn’t last a lifetime. Pragma, the perfect fire, is
sustainable, amazing, transcendent love well worth every bead of
sweat you put into it. So, put the things we discussed into practice.
Work on developing those other types of love. We also have a
worksheet in the back to assist you as you find yourselves in this
transition (or perhaps you’ve already made it through but realize
you didn’t navigate it as well as you could have and need a little
redo). This great migration is nothing to fear; it is another step

<FONT COLOR="#343434">	</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><B>Lust</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
– The lust stage is characterized by seeking sexual satisfaction
and the primary brain chemicals involved are testosterone and
estrogen in varying amounts between men and women. This is part of
what we refer to as Eros (In Love).</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#343434">	</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><B>Attraction</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
– Attraction is also part of what we refer to as Eros. The
attraction stage is characterized by feelings of euphoria or
exhilaration and a very strong craving to be with the person they
feel attracted to. Adrenaline is a brain chemical associated with
such as ‘butterflies in the stomach,’ heart pounding, and
sweating palms and then cortisol also floods in to help the body cope
with the stress of the attraction.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote23anc" HREF="#sdfootnote23sym"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
Dopamine is another chemical we’ve mentioned several times that
increases through the Attraction stage. Dopamine provides the
euphoria and the ‘highs’ associated with being In Love which also
happen to be the same chemicals associated with cocaine use and
explains how and why we are so easily ‘addicted to love.’ Being
In Love in fact creates a brain chemical similar to a drug-induced
state. Alternatively, the brain chemical serotonin decreases during
the attachment phase. Serotonin manages mood, appetite, and sleep.
This explains why we people experience trouble sleeping and eating
when they are In Love. Low levels of serotonin are also observed in
those individuals suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder which
may help explain why we may feel as if we can’t control our
obsessive thoughts about the object of our desire. The Greeks were
right, Eros is unpredictable and these chemicals can easily be pushed
too far to unhealthy obsessive and addictive behaviors.</FONT></P>

associated with security, calmness, comfort, and strong emotional

Gary Chapman’s <I>The 5 Love Languages. </I>In fact, it has had
such a hugely positive effect on our relationship that we had to
dedicate part of our book to it! Needless to say, we consider it a
MUST READ! In the book, Chapman asserts that everyone gives and
receives love in different ways. Where couples can run into trouble,
he says, is when they speak different love languages.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">If
you only speak Spanish and your partner only speaks Mandarin, you’re
going to have a tough time communicating, right? Well, the same goes
with the love languages. It is possible (and probable) for one
partner to be expressing love in a way that does not translate to the
other partner as an expression of love. Dr. Chapman breaks these love
languages into five different categories.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">How
many times have you bought a nice gift for your partner thinking it
would put you over the top, only to get back a grateful indifference?
Chances are you are not speaking your partner’s primary love
language. Once you and your partner understand each other’s love
languages, your expressions of love can become more deliberate and
effective. You’ll be better able to give and receive love in ways
that resonate, which also means more happiness and fulfillment in
your relationship!</P>

right then. So I bought him a watch. He LOVED that watch so much—or
at least he did until he was on an international flight and saw it on

are here to improve and grow and become the best lover we can be to
ourselves and partners, we must make room. It doesn’t need to be a
significant chunk of time. Just enough to express your love. With
small kids, you have to pick and choose your windows. Sam and I had
kids right out of the chute while we were still deep in ErosEros (In
Love). We would sometimes only have three to five minutes to be
romantic or playful before one of the kids rolled up crying with a
load in their pants. You have to take those minutes wherever you can

<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#343434">An affirmation is
something you tell yourself repeatedly and intentionally to convince
your mind that you have it, or are it. The power of affirmation has
been proven over and over again by people from all walks of life.
They all share the common theme that if you have the discipline, you
can change or improve many things about yourself by making daily
affirmations and visualizing. If you want to dive much deeper into
this topic, then I suggest starting with one of the books above. They
are all great, and you will get life-changing knowledge from them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#343434">The reason I mention
affirmations is that they are very, very powerful and are always at
work in our lives whether we practice them daily or don’t even know
what they are. Most affirmations, unfortunately, show up in the form
of negative self-talk. One of the most common I see on a daily basis
is “I am terrible with names.” Yes, you are, and you always will
be as long you tell your brain that every time you have a chance to
remember a name.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Your subconscious mind is
where almost ALL of your brainpower exists. We have all heard we only
use ten percent of our brain, right? Well, that is not accurate, we
USE one hundred percent of our brain. Science, however, can only
explain HOW we use ten percent of it. Glial cells (the other ninety
percent of the brain) control things like affirmations, habits, and
routines, and we are tapping into that every minute without realizing
it. It is where our habits and beliefs are stored that dictate our
self-talk.</FONT></FONT></P>

an answer to a question when you have no idea how you knew that? Have
you ever had a feeling about a number and knew it was the answer to
an equation only never to duplicate that ability again? For example,
I believe I can usually get close to a grocery bill or a restaurant
bill by blurting out the first number that comes to mind. And it
works for me all the time. I would even say that the times I am most
wrong is when I think about it too long.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#343434">How we talk to ourselves,
the mantras we repeat between our ears, can either help us to succeed
faster or hinder our growth. It is no different in your relationship.
How you talk about your partner out loud and what you say to yourself
about them will directly influence your ability to be loving. If I am
thinking to myself or saying out loud how sexy, smart and beautiful
Sam is, I almost immediately want to be with her, hold her, tell her
those things and show her my gratitude. However, there is an adverse
thought process that exists all too frequently in relationships and
makes expressing love more difficult.</FONT></FONT></P>

a huge amount of negative affirmations toward their spouse or
partner. Here are some I have heard in the last few years:</FONT></FONT></P>

harsh, and when I peeled back a few layers, the man who said it

It doesn’t matter how much money you make if that person, your best
friend and the one you chose to spend the rest of your life with, is
unhappy and doesn’t get priority. If that is the case, let’s take
a minute and think about what kinds of things we say to ourselves and
about our partners. Are you reinforcing negative messages toward your
spouse or relationship? Time to change that head noise and maybe even
add a positive affirmation or two to your daily routine.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If you are not an
“affirmations person,” begin by recognizing the negating language
you use and change it. If you say, “My relationship sucks” all
the time, it will eventually be true. Conversely, if you say, “I am
striving to have an incredible relationship, and I will do everything
I can to improve and maximize it,” then you’re creating a very
different reality. If you start here and implement the other things
we are talking about, before long, you will be able to say: “We
have an incredible relationship!” “My partner is amazing!” “I
am excited to see her/him.” If this is the soundtrack between your
ears, then you are in a much better place to express love than you
are if you are constantly reinforcing the negative. It is so much
easier to express love when we think lovingly.</FONT></FONT></P>

he never fails to mention, Paddy is a touch guy. And although
cuddling and hand-holding and tickling his back are all nice, if I
don’t go in for some sexual touch at least a couple times a week,
the wheels start to come off our love bus.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Me?
I grew up in a household with very little snuggling or touching.
Neither my sister or I like to be touched very much—there is a
bubble you should enter only at your own risk—so I feel like it
must have been something we were raised with (or maybe some genetic
defect?). In any case, touch is not my thing. Don’t get me wrong, I
love a good massage and a roll in the hay, but I can go months
without either one.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Needless
to say, our sex life was always this weird point of contention for
Paddy and me. After I found out that it was Paddy’s love language,
I realized that when we made love, he felt the wave of love and
appreciation I felt when he mopped the floor. It all made sense! So,
I tried to do a better job, or so I thought, of speaking his love
language. The minimum was once a week-ish—unless I had a headache
or my period, or my stomach wasn’t right, or any other myriad
excuses I could come up with to get out of it. (Not unlike all of the
excuses Paddy would have for not mopping the floor.)</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Then
one day we were discussing our sex life—again—and he asked me,
“Have we ever had sex, and you regretted it?” I thought, and
thought, and thought, and told him very honestly: Never. Even if I
didn’t have an orgasm or the kids caught us in the act, or even the
time I got those horrible rug burns on my knees, I couldn’t recall
one time in our lives when I regretted having sex with him. So we
agreed to conduct a little experiment: I would say yes every time
Paddy wanted to have sex for a month. We called it “Just Say Yes.”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
prepared myself for the sex-o-rama that I imagined (feared) was about
to befall me. We did make love a few times those first couple days,
but after that, I realized how subtle his sexual advances had become…
I was having a hard time knowing if I was supposed to Just Say Yes!
When Paddy made a subtle advance, and I asked him if this was a Just
Say Yes moment, he would timidly ask, “Do you want it to be?”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">What
was going on here?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I’ll
tell you what was happening. I had rejected Paddy so many times that
he was afraid to initiate sex, even with our agreement. No one wants
to feel rejected or unwanted or unloved, and I realized that every
time I ignored or rejected his attempts at intimacy, Paddy felt those
negative feelings. It was heartbreaking to realize that I had caused
him to feel that way! I decided I would begin initiating during our
experiment. Interestingly enough, I think just making the decision to
initiate sex made me feel more sexual, sexier—and it grew Paddy’s
confidence also.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">And
after the month of our experiment…we never stopped! Some magical
things happened during that month, and we weren’t about to call it
off. Now the deal is if </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">either</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
of us initiates, we Just Say Yes!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">It
took me a good deal of self-reflection to figure out why I’d been
so resistant to having a lot more sex. First of all, as I mentioned,
I love a roll in the hay. I love having sex with Paddy. Looking back,
I feel like I resisted his sexual advances because I viewed it as
some “wifely duty.”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Well,
that and I had this perception of myself that I’m going to share
with you now in all of my vulnerability. No holds barred. Because I
think there are other women who can and will relate.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
was taught that you never had sex with someone unless you </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">loved
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">each other and felt a strong emotional
and intellectual connection. That connection was far more important
than the sex. That anyone who tries to pressure you into having sex
should be arrested. And while those teachings probably served me well
when I was young, they made marriage a little confusing.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Here
was a man who was </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>always</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
trying to pressure me into having sex. And it didn’t matter if I
felt any emotional or any other connection with him. Often sex was
the very last thing on my mind when I felt exhausted, frustrated,
disappointed, or otherwise uninterested in Paddy, and it always
seemed to be the first thing on his mind. I felt, well, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>insulted</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
that he would treat me like a </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">SLUT.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">No

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
had a good friend when we lived in Kansas City, Gabby, who was
happily married to a man who was practically the one hundred percent
opposite of her. She was loud, funny, and you could describe her
personality as bigger than life! She was always the life of the
party. And her husband, Ron, was quiet—so quiet it was hard to get
to know him. He was a little anti-social and didn’t always attend
our gatherings. Outside of them both being extremely intelligent,
they were opposites in every way.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">It
was nearly impossible for Paddy and me to fathom how they could stay
married, let alone how they could be so happy with each other. So one
day I asked her, “What is the secret to your happy marriage?”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">She
looked me right in the eyes and without blinking or hesitating she
said, “Sex. And lots of it.”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
was floored! I never forgot what she said but, unfortunately, it took
me a long time to implement her advice. The month we started Just Say
Yes, Paddy and I both immediately relaxed. Sex wasn’t anything that
needed to be discussed; there were no decisions to make, no
negotiations necessary; it was easy. We just do it. (Oh, and let’s
not confuse “do it” with actual sex. We don’t always have
intercourse, but Just Say Yes always ends with someone—hopefully
both of us—having an orgasm.) There is no fear for either of us of
feeling rejected, unwanted, or unloved.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">The
other thing that happened was Paddy got really happy! He still walks
around like the cock of the walk because he gets laid anytime he
wants. AND, he is more loving, open, and willing to speak my love
language. It intensified our sense of intimacy ten-fold.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">But

has become the way I am able to show my unconditional love for
Paddy—a clear display of PragmaPragma (Truly Loving) and AgapeAgape
(Unconditional Love) love, a physical way to tell him that I will
love him no matter what is going on in and around our world. There is
a kind of transcendence that must happen for you to engage in this
intimate act when you are experiencing negative emotions towards one
another. You have to step out of your ego, the part of you that is
interested only in protecting yourself, the part that manifests fear,
anxiety, distrust, and anger.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Then
you must step into your higher self, the part of you that knows you
must take risks to find true happiness and that you get what you
give. Your higher self knows love is the meaning of life and drives
you to give it every fiber of your being! When we can step out of our
ego for the sake of our love, the experience softens both of us and
gives us immediate, greater perspective. It is much easier to talk
after sex than in the throes of an argument.</FONT></P>

is also something I share with ONLY Paddy. I know there are lots of

as we’ve experimented with some of that, but in our partnership,
we’ve decided sex is something we reserve for only each other. That
in and of itself makes it a sacred act for us.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434"><B>But
what if …</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">When
I suggested Just Say Yes to a friend recently as a first step in
healing her relationship, her response was, “How am I supposed to
do that when I feel so much resentment towards him?” She proceeded
to list all of the things her husband hadn’t done for her lately
amongst some other things he had done she didn’t care for.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">So
how do you get beyond the resentment to engage in this intimate act?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">You
choose to.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Firstly,
recognize that when you need to heal a relationship you have to start
somewhere, and someone has to start. Someone has to make the first
move to bring the love back into the relationship. Sex is such a
clear and simple way to bring the love back, especially when your
partner is a touch person.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Secondly,
do not be fooled into believing all of your emotions deserve of your
attention and merit action. If you do, it allows your emotions to
drag you around your life. You may not be able to decide how you
feel—this is something that just happens in our minds and our
bodies fueled by the thoughts we have—but you can choose how you
act (or don’t act) on those emotions.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">When
I have a negative emotion, I first allow myself to feel it fully. If
you deny the feeling or try to change it too quickly, it will come
back. I focus on how the negative emotion feels in my body: Where do
I feel it? What does it feel like there? Does it burn or tingle or
poke? I let my body go through all of the physicality of the emotion.
I cry if my body wants to cry, with a lump in my throat and tears
streaming down my face, or I experience the wave of adrenaline
rushing through me if I feel angry. I observe myself in the emotion
with as little judgment and as much compassion as I can bring to it.
And then I ask myself what this emotion might be trying to tell me
without allowing my thoughts to tangle me down into the details of
the current scenario.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Let’s
use resentment as our example. First, I check in physically. For me,
resentment feels hot like anger; it feels icky in my stomach. I then
observe my emotions. Resentment tells me I feel hurt and in pain. It
is fueled by thoughts of being treated poorly or unfairly. I know
that when I feel resentful, I’m making assumptions. I assume my
partner has treated me this way both knowingly and intentionally. Or
I unfairly believe my partner should already </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">know
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">their action or inaction would be
hurtful to me.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
recognize that feeling resentful is self-absorbed. That I’m only
taking my feelings into consideration. That I’m blaming Paddy
unfairly or ignoring things I may have contributed to the situation
or cycle. Now I need to decide if I will take action and, if I do,
what action I will take. It may surprise you to know that, when it
comes to resentment, I’ve figured out that the best immediate
action to take is…nothing.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Through—ahem—“trial
and error,” I’ve learned that I should not take any action while
I’m in the middle of feeling this (or any) negative emotion. I know
that I might not be able to act with as much control as I will need
to get the results I want. The best move I can make is to take a
time-out.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Next
I think, “What do I want?” In the case of my close relationship,
I likely want my partner to change, so I no longer feel resentful. If
he’s the one making ME feel bad, he should be the one to change,
right? This is the big mistake most people make while they are trying
to “fix” their relationships. Since you have zero control over
whether your partner changes or not, you need to focus on something
realistic you CAN do.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">You
can start.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">You
can be the one to take the first steps towards healing your
relationship.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">And
one of the quickest and easiest ways to make that first move is to
begin speaking your partner’s love language.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">So
again, we’re sort of back where we started. You know you are
supposed to start speaking your partner’s love language, and you
have felt your resentment fully in all of its discomfort, sooooo now
what?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Gratitude.
Practice some gratitude.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">It
is possible to give your positive emotions a much-needed boost, and
one of the best ways to do it is to practice gratitude. We devote a
full chapter to gratitude and forgiveness later in this book because
your ability to practice these emotions will determine your ability
to love your partner as deeply and wholly as possible.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Personally,
I like to see my gratitude sitting right in front of me. There’s
something about seeing the words that makes them easier for me to
internalize. Give it a try and see for yourself! Get out a piece of
paper and write a full page of things you love about your partner and
the things you feel grateful for in them. Here is what mine looks
like:</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>I love Paddy’s chameleon eyes that change
colors with the colors of his shirt. I love his bright smile, his
hairy chest, and his gray hairs. I love how gracefully he is aging. I
love his laugh and his sense of humor. I love the way his sense of
humor pushes the envelope of “appropriate” and can immediately
disarm people with laughter. I love watching people laugh and feel
joy from Paddy’s jokes and comments. I love Paddy’s huge heart,
his desire to help any and everyone. I love his love for dogs. I love
how Paddy works hard and willingly to support our goals and dreams. I
love how Paddy plans all of our vacations. I love how Paddy never
complains about how dirty our house gets. I love how Paddy’s
eyebrow could shelter us in a storm.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If
you’re still struggling with this activity, try thinking back to
when you first met and fell in love; the things that you loved about
your partner then probably still hold true today, even if you haven’t
seen them surface in a while. And if you are still at a loss, put the
paper in your pocket and during the next few days make it your
MISSION to find things to be grateful to your partner for. Don’t
give up—you can ALWAYS find gratitude.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Practice
this exercise enough, and you will feel more loving towards your

the deal. Just Say Yes!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If
you don’t like sex, you need to read a different book. If you

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">My
subtitle above is a bit of a joke, but in truth it was probably
something I thought after a week or so of Just Say Yes. How cool
would that be? You can have sex whenever you want! If I can get word
of this chapter out, men or those who are more physical will be the
ones bringing this book home. “Honey, let’s read this book about
strengthening our relationships together. I heard the best way to
read it is to skip around, so let’s start with chapter … oh, I
don’t know chapter four maybe?”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">That
would be one way to fuck this up, so I don’t recommend it. But hey,
this is a short book so tough it out, it’s worth it!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">In
the first week, Just Say Yes was a bit of a test for me to see if Sam
would come through on what she promised. I threw it out there two or
three times a day, so I could understand what the real boundaries
were. I was able to get her to say no on the second day when asked
her in the produce section of the grocery store. She passed with
flying colors because even if she had said yes in the grocery store,
I would not have followed through.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Historically,
I typically tried for sex five or six times a week and got it maybe
one. I think sex for a lot of people who have been together for a
while is like that. You get into routines and habits that start
defining where, when, and how you have sex. Many times you start to
tell yourself a story about how sex needs to be good to be worthy of
your time.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">That’s
where Sam was. She was a morning person and was in the habit of
giving me a window between seven thirty and eight thirty a.m. right
after her shower. That was about the time my phone would start
blowing up with emails and work-related things, and my stress level
was rising. So I was not always in a position to accommodate.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
was a night person. I like to go to bed and fool around. She was
always “too exhausted” and would say, “Let’s do it in the
morning.” Sometimes I could trick her by saying, “You go ahead
and go to sleep. I am just going to go down on you for a little
while.” If I got that far I could always change her mind and it was
great. That is what prompted the question. “Have you ever said yes
and then regretted it?”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">The
funny thing is that after Just Say Yes was in full swing and Sam had
passed the initial test, I kind of backed off on asking for sex.
Before, I felt like I needed to ask daily in order to find common
ground weekly. Now, since she has agreed to say yes, I might only ask
two or three times a week, and I try to be conscientious of how she
is feeling.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">We
also seem to be going through a bit of a shift—maybe it’s due to
her sexuality, or maybe it’s due to more frequent sex, but
sometimes she will ask or initiate more than I do. All I can say
about that is: Awesome!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434"><B>How
to Find Passion (It’s right where you put it)</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
had my first epiphany about two and half years into our marriage. Sam
and I were in an intimate moment, and I remember thinking, “Man,
there just isn’t much passion here. It feels like she is just going
through the motions. I don’t know if I can handle having sex with
the same person for the rest of my life if it is going to be this
passionless.” These were my thoughts during and as we lay there
afterward.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Then
it hit me. What was I bringing to the table just then? Wasn’t I
just going through the motions as well? I was providing zero passion
from my side, so why would I expect any in return? I decided then
that I would not be someone who expected something like passion from
someone else. I would BE passionate and see where it got me.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">The
next time we were intimate, I started being more in the moment and
hyper-focused on everything good about that moment as well as
focusing on Sam and what she was feeling in that moment. It is true.
When you give, you get back more than you ever expected. Our sex life
has been fantastic ever since I had that realization and decided to
change.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
have had to remember this passion epiphany a few more times in my
life outside the bedroom. Times when I felt burnt out with my
business or felt like I was not getting enough out of groups I was
involved in. Each time when I stepped outside myself and asked: “What
am I giving?” My answer was always “not much.” I was giving
nothing and expecting everything. Try as I may, I have to keep
remembering that has never worked for me.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Now,
once I recognize it, I immediately choose to turn the tables on the
situation. I double-down and re-apply myself. I focus on the now and
what can I do to make it better. I put my attention on the good
things I may have lost sight of at the moment. Then I decide to make
more of a contribution. Smile, and then add as much value as I can
muster, I find passion every time. Do you know why? It was never lost
in the first place! It’s always there just waiting to be applied.
Passion is where you place it, plain and simple.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Now
that you know the secret of finding passion, go apply your efforts to
the things that need it most. Then sit back and watch how fulfilling
those things become. Sounds too easy, doesn’t it? I promise it
works. Just be the giver, and you will receive.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
thought I would throw this in since we are talking about getting
lucky. During ErosEros (In Love), we are turned on by everything. The
newness can usually carry us for a while. But as we migrate to
PragmaPragma (Truly Loving) and get more into routines and let our
inhibitions grow, sex can become just okay. I know plenty of couples
who have echoed this sentiment. My advice? Don’t let that happen!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If
I were the same lover Sam had married, no way would we still be
together. Fortunately, she trained me well by communicating a lot
about what she likes and what she doesn’t like. “Move up,”
“More to the left,” “More gentle,” “Yeah, that’s it.”
She trained me so well that I think it was a significant factor in
saving our marriage. Even though we were split up, she allowed me to
seduce her throughout the separation. I figured it was my subtle game
that reeled her back in, only later to find out that she just wanted
sex with someone who she knew did it right.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If
you find sex becoming less than spectacular, then one or both of you
are not communicating enough. Or possibly you have narrowed your
routine so much that it is becoming boring. Don’t forget about
LudusLudus (Friendship Love)! It has its place in the bedroom as much
as anywhere. Be playful, stretch out the foreplay, reevaluate your
inhibitions and expand your horizons some. Educate yourselves on new
things to try, and then try them out. Especially you parents.
Sometimes we change physically and need to go about it in different
ways. Communicate how you are feeling, what feels good and what
doesn’t. Do whatever it takes to get back to having great sex
again.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Once
you have committed to a partner and you’re in a serious
relationship, there are decisions you used to make on your own that
you now have to share with your partner. This is especially true if
you have children and/or cohabitate. Sure, there are plenty of
decisions you will still make independently—but when you decide to
share your life with someone else, it also means designing your life
and making decisions together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">There
are two places where finding the same page is critical: First, you
need to determine which decisions need to be made together. Once you
know which decisions you will share, the next step is to find that
same page so you can come to an agreement. And to do that, it is all
about communication!</P>

<B>SHE SAID: Opposites attract and then disagree on </B><I><B>everything</B></I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
can’t tell you what percentage of couples are opposites of one
another. Paddy and I are opposites in many, many ways. I am a neat
freak, and he is not. I say work hard; he says work smart. I am an
introvert who is slightly risk-averse; Paddy is an extrovert who is
very comfortable taking risks. I could go on and on here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
think part of why people are often attracted to their opposites is
because we subconsciously recognize those things that will make us
more complete, to fill in the holes so to speak. And this can be an
amazing thing when it works smoothly. However, it also can be a
fairly consistent source of misunderstandings, discomfort,
disagreements, and flat-out fights. Forever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">So
how do you navigate those differences?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Communication,
communication, communication! And MOST of the communicating I’m
talking about is actually listening. Fully focused, not just on the
words your partner is speaking but also their tone, body language,
and facial expressions. Trying to understand him or her. Intently and
actively listening.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
hate to break it to you, but multi-tasking while you “listen”
doesn’t count.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
always thought I was paying attention when Paddy was talking, but I
counted those times when I was looking at shit on my phone—playing
games like Trivia Crack and Words With Friends or cruising Facebook,
and responding to Paddy with a head nod or a “yeah”—as
listening. I mean I <I>could</I> hear him after all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">That’s
how I ended up agreeing to go on a trip to hang out with his rugby
buddies in Butt Fuck, West Virginia. Clearly, I wasn’t paying as
much attention as I thought I had been. Spending my vacation
traveling fourteen hours to a dingy old hotel to hang out with a
bunch of glory-days-reliving dudes was the wake-up call I needed to
make a change in my listening habits.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<B>HE SAID: Frostburg</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Okay,
first of all, we were in Western Maryland, not Butt-Fuck, West
Virginia. And they were not “rugby” buddies; it was a lacrosse
team reunion. Oh, and that shitty hotel was the nicest one in town.
Bam! Same page. That was easy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Actually,
it makes no difference to me whether the event was in Maryland or
West Virginia, or whether it was rugby or lacrosse—what matters is
that Sam agreed to come along and share it with me because I asked
her to. How we got to that page is of little importance. How she
remembers it doesn’t matter either. She went, and I love her for
it. End of story.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<B>Back to SHE SAID:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Changing
my habit was a bit harder than I expected. It was easy to give Paddy
my full attention when he was talking about something that interested
me, but what about those times when it wasn’t? What about those
times where his interest or viewpoint is the opposite of mine? I had
to work out a solution that made it easier to up my attentiveness
during those times when my mind started to wander. The trick I’ve
learned is to tap back into my gratitude for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">For
instance, Paddy loves—insists on, actually—getting a good deal.
Sometimes he brings home things we don’t need, but he couldn’t
pass up the deal. I rarely buy things we don’t need, but I when I
do, I buy them without too much thought about if I’m getting the
most for my money. But I’ve found things to appreciate about my
deal-hunting husband.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">NOW,
when he goes on and on about a great deal he found, I think about how
very appreciative I am that he works hard to find them. We’d be
tens of thousands of dollars poorer if I were in charge of the
majority of our shopping and travel! Plus, I recognize how much joy
he gets out of the accomplishment, and I love it when he is happy! So
I set the intention to listen, find things to appreciate and work
very hard to give him my full attention. Paddy deserves nothing less.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Here
are some more tips for improving your listening skills:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Remove
all distractions.</B> Stop whatever you’re doing, and focus on what
your spouse is saying so much that you could repeat what they said
back to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Some
communication experts say you should then also <B>repeat back what
you heard</B>. I would love this, but Paddy does not have the
patience for this kind of communication. If I repeat what he said
back to him, he’ll respond with, “I just said that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Instead,
my policy has been that if the conversation is about something
important or I’m in any way confused about what is being discussed,
then the repeat-back is a great strategy. It not only shows the other
person you are listening if the topic is important, but it also
prevents miscommunication because it gives your partner the
opportunity to clarify the message, just in case it wasn’t received
correctly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
repeat-back strategy is also extremely helpful when the conversation
becomes emotional, if the other person seems agitated or annoyed in
any way, or if you begin to feel upset or irritated. According to the
research conducted by the authors of <I>Crucial Conversations</I>,
when a conversation starts to get emotional, most people go into
Fight or Flight mode. They either stop listening because they are
thinking about what they are going to say next, how they will launch
their defense or counter-attack—that’s Fight. Or they’ll shut
down and shut up—that’s Flight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
have witnessed both of these natural reactions in both Paddy and
myself during arguments. It is useful to understand that our bodies
were made to face great adversity and gifted with adrenaline that
would increase our chances of survival if threatened. Those gifts
don’t work as well in the modern era, where verbally negotiating or
working through emotional issues doesn’t pose the same threat as
facing wild animals that want to eat us. But our bodies do not know
the difference.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
we start to get worked up just a tiny bit, most of the blood rushes
from our brains to our bodies preparing us for the Fight or the
Flight. This is exactly opposite of what we need in those situations,
and that’s why the repeat-back strategy is go great. It slows us
down and makes us focus on what our partner is actually saying. You
cannot listen and also create a strategy to demolish your opponent,
nor can you shut down. The repeat-back creates space for you to
better understand one another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Finally,
<B>never withhold your attention.</B> And remember, there are
negative consequences of withholding your attention from you
partner—and they’re worse than a shitty vacation. If you don’t
listen attentively to your partner, you risk him feeling
insignificant and ignored. And that goes for anyone else in your life
too! Attentive listening is a life skill. WORK at becoming a good
listener, and it will pay off—<I>especially if you and your partner
are opposites!</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Get
on the Same Page</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Now,
let’s talk about one area where it can be especially difficult to
be opposite from your partner: the big decisions that drive your
life. When dealing with something that is going to impact your lives
every day, like how you manage your money, it’s not enough to say,
“You do you, and I’ll do me.” You’ve both got to work toward
getting on the same page in a functional way—by which I mean that
neither you nor your partner has to change <I>per se</I>; you just
have to find a solution in the middle that you can both adhere to so
you can get stuff done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Let’s
use money as an example since that can be a huge point of contention
for couples.<SUP> <A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote25anc" HREF="#sdfootnote25sym"><SUP>25</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">If
you are anything like Paddy and me, the way you view and handle money
is different—maybe even opposite. How can the two of you get on the
same page financially?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">First,
you’ve got to get on the same page at a very high level. Start with
your values. What are your top values? How do those values translate
to your top goals? Then, how do your values and goals translate to
your finances and financial goals? There is a worksheet called The
Financial Same Page at the end of the book that can help you work
through these questions. It’s all trickle-down economics from there
(ha ha).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
Paddy and I were first married, our top values were each other and
raising our children. These values translated to goals of having a
home to live in with plenty of food on our table and clothes on our
backs. It meant spending quality time together. We wanted our
children to have good educations all the way through high school, and
we wanted to be able to pay for their college should they decide they
wanted to go. We also wanted to retire, preferably early if possible.
Financially it meant we both needed to work to pay for our home,
food, clothes, and a few dates a month, plus have enough to start
saving for college for the kids and retirement. Boom! Here was the
shared foundation for our financial life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">By
creating our shared vision for the life we wanted to have together,
we created the “same page” from which we could craft our mutual
approach to money. Our budget centered on (and stemmed from) our
values and goals. From there, we could build out individualized
approaches that would make it easier for both of us to adhere to the
plan. We factored in some “free” money for each of us. We agreed
to a one-time spending limit. If one of us wants to purchase
something over a certain dollar amount, we both need to sign off on
the expense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">It
is a good idea to sit down on a regular basis (annually works for us)
and realign to ensure you’re living according to your agreed
values. I don’t remember having any high-level, value- and
goal-based discussions about our finances in the years before our
break-up. We bickered over how we were spending money, but it wasn’t
as urgent as the conversations we had when we didn’t actually have
any money. Had we maintained the discipline to continue those
discussions, they could have led us to talk through our priorities
(which we agreed were our children and each other). Maybe we could
have made adjustments before reaching our breaking point?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">It
is also a good idea to go through your budget and track how you are
doing. Are you following the budget and staying within the guidelines
you created? It is good to do this at least monthly (weekly is ideal)
and make adjustments as necessary. And when it comes to big financial
decisions—large purchases, accumulating debt, or selling assets—you
need to find the same page. Agree to stay in the conversation until
you can come to a creative and mutually agreeable solution. And,
yeah, it may be that it takes multiple weeks or months before you
come to an agreement, but just keep talking until you get there. KEEP
UP THE ENDEAVOR! It is a healthy and necessary part of your marriage
and the longer you do it, the easier it will be. (Really.)</P>

how we got there. For example, we sometimes disagree on how to do
something. “I usually do it this way,” Sam will say. “Yes that

this way and here is why.” The same page was that we both wanted
the project done. It is done. Yet here we are arguing about the
differences within our specific techniques. “Keep your eyes on the

rule of thumb here. Do not get sucked into the differences of the

<FONT COLOR="#00000a"><FONT COLOR="#000000">This is a huge pitfall in
most relationships. For some reason, we all seem to have an inherent
desire to be right. For some, it is so important that you ignore that
you were on the same page and continue the disagreement just because
you didn’t hear the words “you were right.” Disagreements are
fine; we will all have them. But you have to defuse them before they
turn into harsh words. If that happens, then you have a whole other
can of worms to deal with. We’ll discuss that can of worms in depth

have to say you were wrong to stay on the same page with your

right, I must have misunderstood.” That wasn’t so hard, was it?
And look, here we are, on the same page!</FONT></FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">You
probably recall the three most basic rules of fire safety. They’ve
been drilled into most of since we were kids and are easily summed up
in a catchy phrase: Stop, Drop, and Roll.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
you are on fire: You need to STOP! The instinct is to run, but this
only feeds the flames with much-needed oxygen. Then you need to DROP:
literally, drop to the ground. Then you ROLL on the ground to
extinguish the flames. If you didn’t learn this in school or
elsewhere, you’re welcome. Now you know what to do should you ever
catch on fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Obviously,
we don’t catch on fire as a result of being in a relationship, but
we do have traumas that will burn us up physically and/or
emotionally, completely change our worlds and the way we live in
them. We’re talking about trauma, tragedy, injury, sickness and
death. We’re also talking about other issues like depression and
discontent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">How
you handle turmoil that erupts in your life or the life of your
partner can either make or break your relationship. If you live long
enough, you can guarantee you will have to deal with major emotional
issues as friends and family members pass, as we all must. You will
be faced with your own injuries and illness as well as those of your
partner. If you don’t weather these storms gracefully, you can
count on more storms and more difficult times to come. However, get
this right, and the bond between you will be as strong as any love
bond that exists. It will be a giant leap on your way to PragmaPragma

<B>SHE SAID: When the sky is falling…</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">It
was our daughter’s birthday and we were out on our boat in a lake
in the mountains, wake boarding, surfing, water skiing, and just
hanging out with close friends and family. It was a perfect day. Blue
skies, sunshine, great company. Then my parents called. I ignored the
call the first time thinking it likely had something to do with the
dinner plans we had the next night, but after the third call, I
answered. It was my mother. She was crying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">“Daddy
is dead!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">“What?”
I asked her not really wanting her to repeat what she just said but
also not sure I heard her correctly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">“Daddy
is dead!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">My
dad had died suddenly that afternoon watching television on the couch
while my mom was out running errands. I was devastated. My dad was
not only my dad but had become one of my best friends over the past
few years. We started a few businesses and took up motorcycle riding
together. In fact, we had just returned from a motorcycle trip to
Nevada only three days before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Paddy
scooped me up in his arms when I collapsed. He then carried me for
weeks. He took care of everything while I grieved and managed all of
those things needing attention when someone close to you passes. He
gave me anything I needed from him—not just the logistics of
ensuring our kids were cared for and keeping our household running,
but also all those things I needed from him to help me get through
the tragedy. One minute I needed him to hold me, and the next minute
I needed space and time to process. He never judged or criticized. I
always felt loved. I am eternally grateful, and his unwavering
compassion created a bond and a trust that was reminiscent of
<FONT COLOR="#252525"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">StorgēStorgē
(Love Between Children &amp; Parents)</SPAN></FONT> love and the
embodiment of AgapeAgape (Unconditional Love) love. Paddy literally
did everything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">This
was what we call <I>Stop, Drop, </I><I>and</I><I> Roll</I>. And the
story of losing my dad is both an extreme and a clear example of it
in action.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
you realize your partner is distraught, struggling, crying, upset, or
things are not okay, your job is to STOP whatever you are doing, DROP
everything, and ROLL with them to help to put out the fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
talking about death or loss, “Rolling” means to ease the
suffering or soothe your partner’s distress as best you can. So in
my example, Paddy first physically held me while I was on the phone
with my mother and while I cried uncontrollably for many minutes
after that. I’m not sure he even knew what was wrong at that point;
he just knew something was upsetting me terribly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">However,
Rolling is rarely as simple as dealing with the immediate emotions.
There are almost always other steps that need to be taken to cope
with distressing situations. Sometimes it will be as simple as a
conversation where you engage in active listening with your partner.
Other times it will be much more involved, with multiple ongoing
conversations, emotional outbursts, and sometimes it may even require
life changes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Tragedy
always leaves us changed, and that goes for our close relationships
as well. It seems these events or traumas can either tear people
apart or pull people together. However, there are a few things that
will help you to survive these lows when you are the helping partner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Eliminate
</B><B>judgment</B><B> and criticism. </B>When your partner is
struggling, judging them for it, deciding if it is right or wrong,
good or bad, or whether they should or should not be struggling is a
complete waste of time. It doesn’t matter. What does matter is that
they are hurting, and you love them and want to help them any way you
can. If you feel yourself getting annoyed or edgy, ask yourself if
you are judging or being critical. If your answer is yes, take a
moment to identify the judgment or criticism and let it go. If you
can master it, this technique will create more space for love and
acceptance in both yourself and your partner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Don’t
be afraid to ask your partner what they need. </B>It’s great when
you can anticipate their needs, but often our instincts are more
aligned with what <I>we</I> need or want. I recently heard a story of
a husband who came to the funeral of one of his wife’s close
relatives and left to play golf immediately after it ended. She was
deeply hurt, but he had no idea he’d done anything wrong—he had
gone to the funeral, after all. That’s why it’s important to ask.
Sometimes your partner won’t know, and if that’s the case, don’t
be afraid just to try some stuff. Sometimes, especially during times
of tragedy, just being physically present can go a long way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Don’t
take it personally if your partner is not as appreciative as you
hoped (or at all). </B>Often we are not at our best during difficult
times. Emotions are on the surface and raw, we may be experiencing
more pain than we ever thought we could endure, and it’s possible
our patience and gratitude aren’t where we want them to be. If your
partner snaps at you, know it has nothing to do with you and don’t
let it get you down. As Paddy would say, “Don’t own it!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Listen,
listen, listen. And then listen some more. </B>There’s a good
chance your partner will just want you listen, and talking through
the issue may reduce or relieve some of his or her pain. Honestly,
have you ever come out of a conversation thinking, “JEEZ, that guy
listens too much”? Um, nope. I’ve never heard that. Ever.
Everyone loves a good listener.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>If
your partner asks for your help or tells you what they need, make
every effort to do those things. </B>There are many people who say
asking for help is the most difficult thing to do in a relationship,
so when your partner asks for help, realize it may not be easy for
them. Don’t take it lightly. And how great is it not to have to
guess! Take advantage of the advantage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Don’t
give up!</B> Don’t go passive and stop trying if and when it seems
like nothing is helping. Your partner needs you to keep trying!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">On
the flip side, there are also things you need to know as the partner
receiving help:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Let
your partner help you. </B>I know a couple who went through a
situation similar to Paddy’s and mine. Her father died, and she was
also devastated. Her husband loves her very much and tried his very
best to help her. To hear her tell it, he did everything right—but
she couldn’t accept his help. She virtually shut him out, and it
nearly cost them their marriage. If you find yourself refusing help,
support, or love from your partner, STOP doing that! There are few
things more hurtful than not allowing your partner to help you. Know
that you might be hurting them when you refuse their help.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Don’t
be afraid to ask for help or tell them what you need. </B>Paddy often
touches me—not just when I’m struggling, but all the time—and
he steps it up a notch when he is worried about me or trying to
comfort me. I’ve learned this is his way of helping, and I try to
be as gracious as I can. Then there are times when I really don’t
want anyone to touch me, when what I need is to be left completely
alone. And I can kindly say to Paddy, “Baby, I love you, and I love
your touch and your company, but I think what I need right now is
just to be by myself.” Because Paddy doesn’t “own it,” he
takes the input gracefully and gives me the alone time I need.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Sometimes
the struggles aren’t tragedy; sometimes it is a longer-term
dissatisfaction, minor distress, or mere annoyance. The good news is
these strategies work anytime you need help or need to give help.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<B>HE SAID: Lean on me</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
was having a conversation with my buddy Pat about his marriage. He
and his wife Kim have been married more than twenty years and,
according to Pat, have never come close to calling it quits. They
chalked it up to one reason: If Kim ever became frustrated or unhappy
with their relationship, Pat would stop and prioritize her
frustration and unhappiness until she felt better about their
situation. It didn’t matter how busy or preoccupied he might’ve
been, if his wife was unhappy, it was a Stop, Drop, and Roll
situation. Pat recognized that Kim and his family was his <I>Why,</I>
his meaning of life, and if that was broken it needed to be fixed
ASAP. Everything else would wait. “What’s the point of everything
else if your wife and kids are unhappy?” he asked me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
couldn’t have said it better myself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
truth is that Stop, Drop, and Roll is not quite so easy as Pat makes
it sound. It’s complicated and requires understanding, patience and
well-timed empathy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Most
men have a deep-seated need to fix broken things. Especially those
who are self-made or leaders. We are natural-born problem solvers. We
don’t like it when stuff is broken, incompatible, or out of whack,
so we try to fix it. (Many women right now might be wondering, “If
this is true, then why is the garage door still broken after three
years of limited function?” Well just because we like to fix things
doesn’t mean we are all handymen.) The things we like to fix
usually have to do with people. That’s why our teams are usually so
strong.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Speaking
for myself, I know that when Sam or the kids have problems I tend to
immediately swoop in and try to FIX the problem for good. However,
that is not what is always needed. Often the need is that of a more
empathetic and listening nature and can’t be fixed overnight. Some
things may take months.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
second time Stop, Drop, and Roll popped up this year, was a
completely different scenario. It was a situation where this strategy
was critical, but the person I was talking to had no idea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">My
good friend Ernest, who has had a couple of failed marriages, was
imparting wisdom to a younger mutual friend Ryan, who had just gotten
engaged. At the time I thought this hugely hypocritical. Without
hearing his message, I made an immediate negative judgment. That
error on my part can be discussed in another book, called <I>I Was
Wrong. AGAIN!</I> Fortunately for me, I later had a discussion with
Ryan and he told me what Ernest had related.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Ernest,
he said, told him that his most recent wife was everything he wanted
and that the relationship was awesome. He said that she adored him
and that he got “charged” by that adoration. He was hugely
grateful, usually reciprocated and they were very happy. Then one day
her thirteen-year-old dog died. (She had the dog well before Ernest
had come along and since she had no kids of her own, the dog was “her
baby.”) She went into a depression and shut down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
that happened the adoration stopped, Ernest was no longer the center
of her universe. She was not filling up his tank and giving him the
“charge” he had come to expect from her. So he immediately went
into “fix it” mode. He applied empathy for a short while but then
became impatient with her depression: “It was just a dog.” “You
need to snap out of it.” “I am a person who is right here and
needs you.” He was no longer getting that “charge” from her,
and now he was hurting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Technically
this story is a two-part lesson, as this is a classic case of relying
on someone else to give you fulfillment instead of yourself. You have
to love yourself first, as you well know by now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">In
the end, they were not able to make it work. According to Ernest, she
changed and was no longer the person he married. Several years later
he realized the HUGE mistake he had made. He had used her adoration
to validate himself (fill his tank). When it stopped, he became
restless and grouchy and could not see how badly she needed him. He
couldn’t set it all aside and be there for her for a while. He had
let her down when she needed him most. It was a powerful lesson in
Stop, Drop, and Roll that he had learned years too late.</P>

<B>A Note on Grief</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
For most of you, like me, your partner is a very large part of your
<I>Why</I><I>.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
Recognizing this we must also remember that we need to always be
there for them and never give the perception that we are not.
Sometimes being there means that we have to let grief run its course
and do anything we can just to help them feel loved and supported. We
may need to put other things on hold while we are focusing on being
there. We need to be there, knowing we may not be able to “fix”
it. We need to be there, knowing that it will take time—possibly
more time than we think. We still need just to be there. Completely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
To sum it all up, to me, Stop, Drop, and Roll means two things:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.1in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">

you ever met a couple and immediately felt envious of their
relationship? As awesome as we are together, we have friends with a
seriously enviable marriage. Their names are Bob and Usha. They have
been married for almost thirty years, but they are so sweet and
tender to one another you’d think they were still in the honeymoon
phase. Whenever we’re around them, we always reflect on how they
take such good care of one another. They communicate with such grace
and patience; they frequently ask each other if they are okay or
whether they need anything from one another. They are often holding
hands or snuggling.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">They
also seem to be each other’s biggest fans. They laugh the loudest
at each other’s jokes, they compliment each other, and they point
out the strengths of their partner to others. It never comes off as
bragging as these are two of the most authentic, giving, spiritual
people you’ll ever meet, it just comes off that they think the
world of each other. You also get an overwhelming feeling of how
grateful they are to have each other.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">That,
in a nutshell, is what it means to be your partner’s biggest fan.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">This
is something I strive to be for Paddy. I endeavor to be his biggest
fan, and I think it makes me a better wife because I’m always
looking for the good stuff he does to compliment and share with
others. I want to lift him up and it must be working because recently
Paddy’s cousin Dan said, “Sam, you talk about Pat like he’s the
smartest guy in every room, and you go further than that. You do more
than compliment him; you fiercely advocate for him if you feel he is
being slighted or treated unfairly.” He went on to say we also
compliment one another’s ideas, even if we don’t agree with them.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I

<FONT COLOR="#343434"><B>SHE SAID: Careful with teasing and never
talk shit</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Some
couples, us included, tease each other. There is nothing wrong with
teasing, as I would consider this to be part of LudusLudus
(Friendship Love) love. It can be cute and endearing as long as it’s
described in a light of amusement and admiration. I think the things
we love and miss about someone often are not their blaring strengths
but idiosyncrasies and habits that make them uniquely themselves.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">But
there are times when teasing isn’t a good strategy—and that is a
delicate tightrope to walk. If you decide to tease your partner,
watch their face. Are they smiling? No smile, no more teasing. And
frankly, I think the same rule should apply even if your partner
isn’t in the room. Before you make a comment about your partner to
someone else, consider: “Would this make my spouse stop smiling if
they heard it?” If your answer is yes, you probably shouldn’t say
it.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
recently met the new wife of a friend of mine. As we were
chatting—just the two of us—I asked her if she had ever met my
husband, Paddy. She said she didn’t think so and I said, “I can’t
wait until you meet him! He’s fun!”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Her
response took me a little by surprise: “I’m so glad you said
that! I have so many friends and know so many women who have nothing
nice to say about their husbands. I don’t get it! I mean, you
married the man, don’t you have anything nice to say?” The more I
thought about it later, the sadder her comment made me feel.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">When
I was a teenager, I read an article in a fashion magazine that said
the fastest and easiest way to make friends is to find something in
common, and a good place to start is by complaining about something.
The advice stuck with me because it was one hundred percent right.
Unfortunately, talking shit actually does work as a strategy to
kindle kinship. However, it also demonstrates and then continues to
encourage negativity. I don’t know about you, but I don’t need
any more negativity in my life—and don’t want it in my
marriage—so I don’t use that strategy to make friends.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">AND,
I think this strategy sucks even more i</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">f
you are talking shit about your partner to gain closeness with a
friend. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve talked plenty of shit, and I’ve
talked plenty of shit about Paddy—especially when we were on the
brink of divorce—but you’ll be hard pressed to hear me talk shit
about anyone anymore. It is bad form on so many levels.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">For
one thing, talking shit severely erodes trust! Don’t be fooled by
thinking it just erodes trust with your partner only if you get
caught or what you said gets back to them. Even if the person you are
talking to doesn’t consciously think or say this, deep down there
is a part of them that is wondering what you might say about them
when you are not in their company. This is ESPECIALLY true if you are
talking trash about your partner! Think about it. If this is the
person you’ve committed your life to, the person you are supposed
to love and trust the very most in the entire world, and they are
also supposed to love and trust you the very most in the entire
world, what kind of a chance does anyone else in your world have?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Don’t
ever talk poorly about your partner to anyone else. If you need
advice, you can speak in confidence with a close friend but stick to
the facts.  If you stray from the facts the advice won’t be any
good anyhow.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If
you won’t be your partner’s biggest fan, who will? You should be
their biggest fan—and the way you do that is you continually focus
on all the good stuff. His fabulous smile, her amazing sense of
humor, his dedication to his family, her consideration of people’s
feelings. Forget about the flaws—we all have them—and since what
you focus on gets bigger, do you want more flaws or more good stuff?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">An
amazing magical thing happens when you and your partner are each
other’s biggest fans. You start to relax into is this very

anyone will ever really love you never crosses your mind again. You
become more comfortable in your own skin knowing the person who knows
you the very best, loves you the very most!</FONT></P>

<B>HE SAID: </B><B>My </B><I><B>Why</B></I><B> defined and explained</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
have mentioned the term your <I>Why</I> before and will likely refer
to it again. For me, it is not as complicated to define as it is to
explain, but I’m going to give it a shot in this chapter. By
definition, my <I>Why</I><I> </I>are Sam and the kids. It is my mom
and my dad, my close friends and those I care most about. These are
my loved ones. They are my reasons why I do what I do. They are my
biggest fans and I am theirs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Now
that I’ve defined, let me try to explain:</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Sam
is a songwriter and has been since before we met. She writes the most
amazing songs that pull at your heartstrings and bring tears to your
eyes. At our wedding, she surprised me by playing a song she wrote in
place of her vows. It made me cry in front of my whole family, which
is a testament to how important she is to me. I fancied myself a big
strong man who was not easily rattled, but I had no problem showing
her how incredible that song made me feel. I had appreciated her
talent before, but there was no question after that moment I was
going to be her biggest fan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">As
fans, we all take some credit for the success of the ones we root
for. We wear their jerseys, we put bumper stickers on our cars, we go
to the concerts, and we buy the products. We are quick to remind
people that we did not come from the bandwagon, that we have been
there since the beginning. It is almost inherent that we want to brag
about those things. They mean so much to us and we want other people
to know that we are fans and that our support played a part in their
success. At least that’s what happens with me; I gush when I am
proud.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">While
Sam’s songwriting is awesome, there is so much more light that she
brings to the world. If she never wrote or performed another song, I
would still be right there standing in front of the metaphorical
stage, staring up at her in speechless awe. She is giving, confident,
introspective, and genuinely caring and all loving. I strive to one
day be all that she has become. I will always be her biggest fan. You
may be gagging right now after all of that, but it is how I feel. I
am so proud that I get to play a part in her life. See? Gushing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
have had twenty-one years to get to where we are, but I can’t say I
was always Sam’s biggest fan. I am certain that during our year
apart I was the guy hauling a bag of rotten tomatoes to her concert.
Ready to lob a volley of heckles and boos mixed with airborne
nightshades at her. I had forgotten who she was and most importantly
who I was. As our partner’s biggest fan, we need always to remember
who they are and who we are. But it does take some time. We have to
learn to accept the losses as much as the wins, maybe more so,
because that is when they need us most. It is when you endear
yourself as a true fan. It doesn’t happen overnight; it grows with
your love. To be the biggest fan you have to become and remain truly
devoted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Our
spouses, partners, and families are the ones who will always be there
for us, and we need to be there for them the best way we can. I want
to make them proud of me. I want to set a good example for them. I
want them to pay it forward by carrying those same virtues within
themselves. I want to arm them with everything they need to succeed
any way they desire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">While
it can be an incredible validation when those we root for achieve
success, it should not be what we use to validate our loved ones.
Often there is no measurable achievement, and there will be times
when those we root for take some steps backward. Being a true fan—the
biggest fan—is about complete support of and faith in those loved
ones. Win or lose we need to be by their side supporting them any way
we can. It is about love. This love does not fall into a defined love
language, and while it is most described by AgapeAgape (Unconditional
Love) love, it is only unconditional until it is not. It is a love
that must come with the territory of having relationships.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.19in; line-height: 200%">My
<I>Why</I>, in essence, is to be the biggest fan. I am proud of those
I love, and I want them to be proud of me. Almost everything I do,
including the things that are for me, is aimed at growing and
enhancing that love.</P>

Shit Goes Down—Defuse the Situation</B></FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Some
fights are attempts to get on the same page about decisions, and
others are about getting on the same page when you don’t need to be
on the same page. Many fights, deep down, are disagreements about
fulfilling each other’s needs. Sometimes just recognizing which
scenario a discussion falls into can begin to defuse a situation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">It
goes without saying that the best way to fight is to avoid fighting
altogether. If categorizing the type of discussion doesn’t defuse
it, this chapter includes some other tactics we use to avoid fights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<B>SHE SAID: You have the power</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">You
love your partner and every communication with him or her is an
opportunity to express love.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
I first heard this idea, I thought it was total woo-woo
bullshit—completely unrealistic. What if Paddy isn’t expressing
love to me? What if he is doing and saying hurtful, insensitive
things? Isn’t it my right (maybe even my obligation) to say and do
hurtful things back, so he knows how bad it feels? The Bible says an
eye for an eye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">There
is something funny about “hurtful, insensitive things” … the
first of which is that we all perceive “hurtful” and
“insensitive” differently. It’s a very subjective thing. The
things I feel are hurtful may not rattle you at all and vice versa.
And since this is so very subjective, often a person’s intention is
misunderstood. Sometimes people say and do things without any
intention of harm. If you knew the intention was not to be hurtful or
cause you harm, would that affect how you felt about it?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">As
the receiver of messages (verbal and nonverbal) you perceive to be
hurtful, you should consider that you may be misconstruing the
intention and give the deliverer of the message the benefit of the
doubt. Tell yourself you are not under attack because even if you
are, your best reaction is the same.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Here
is the thing: If you believe someone intends to hurt you, you will
likely have a very negative feeling about it, and you will also
likely have a very negative reaction. However, neither of these
things will help you or the messenger or your relationship. A
negative reaction now also pulls the messenger down, and now you both
feel like shit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
thing here is, you may not always get to decide how you feel about
something because often emotions well up quickly before we even
really know what is happening. (Although I will tell you the more you
practice thinking “I am not under attack” and giving people the
benefit of the doubt, your feelings will also start to change. It
takes some time but it rewires your brain, and soon you won’t even
have those negative feelings because you no longer feel attacked.
Even if you are being attacked—because as you’ll learn, it’s
completely irrelevant.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>You
ALWAYS get to DECIDE how you will react to anything and everything in
your life.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Think
about that. YOU ultimately are all powerful. You have the power to
create a downward spiral of crappy annoyance, anger, hurt, and
sadness in yourself and others by the way you choose to REACT or you
can create a non-issue or even a positive experience for you both.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Paddy
and I used to have some pretty raunchy fights, and it was partly due
to my anger management issues. (Okay, fine, it was <I>mostly</I> due
to my anger management issues.) I used to think that having temper
tantrums was an entirely effective method of communication. I blame
my grandfather who had a bad temper and whose last name was Temple,
and thus my anger outbursts were aptly called the “Temple Tantrum”
in our household. I’m embarrassed that it took me so long to figure
out that what I was doing wasn’t healthy for my family or myself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">My
outbursts and the subsequent reactions were bad—we’re talking
screaming, slamming of doors, slamming of drawers, sleeping on the
couch, airing out our shit in front of friends, and more. Paddy and I
had so many disagreements—because we are opposites—and had no
idea how to work through them. And it was usually me on the offensive
launching attacks. He’d spent too much money; he wasn’t spending
enough time with me; he wasn’t spending enough time with the kids;
he didn’t take out the garbage. I was extremely critical of him,
just as I was of myself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Early
in our marriage, Paddy would vehemently defend himself, either
through denial or by telling me it just wasn’t important. There was
also the tactic of launching his counterattack—usually founded on
how I was yelling at him and the number of “fucks” I had said in
the past thirty seconds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">As
we’ve gotten older, he sometimes uses humor to defuse my anger. I
remember screaming on and on and looking over at Paddy, who had
removed his shirt, pushed his belly out as far as he could and was
rubbing it gently. He looked into my eyes sadly and said in all
seriousness, “You’re upsetting the baby.” We both started
laughing, and by the end of our giggle session, I couldn’t even
remember what we were talking about. This doesn’t always work, I
will warn you, and if I was really on the warpath or the topic was
very sensitive, this would have backfired and I would have likely
added to the “fuck you” count as I stormed out of the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">And
now? Well, I rarely get mad because I know what a waste of time and
energy it is. That was all it took was for me to change my behavior
completely. I realized it was ineffective, meaning there were better
and more efficient ways of getting things done. Not only that but
there were other ways I could handle it, and use the situation (and
my reaction to it) to build and grow our love instead of ripping it
down. Here are some tactics you can use:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Ignore
bad behavior.</B> This means exactly what it says. I used to say a
lot of mean and awful things when I had my Temple Tantrums. I wanted
Paddy to feel bad. When he would react, it would fuel the fire and,
in my mind, justify saying more bad things. When he didn’t respond
and acted like I hadn’t said a thing, it confused me, and I would
pause. The pause was usually enough for me to self-reflect and
realize what a bitch I was being.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Let
it go.</B> Sometimes Paddy doesn’t say anything, and he chooses to
let it go—and when I say let it go, I mean he never talks about it
again. Sometimes I would go “silent,” and it seemed like I was
letting it go but really I was putting it into my bag of ammo—adding
another data point to help launch my next offensive attack. But Paddy
truly lets it go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Apologize.</B>
Other times he apologizes if he sees I’m upset about something.
Sometimes he apologizes for what he thinks might have upset me and
sometimes he can’t apologize for anything because he doesn’t know
what he did wrong. So he simply says, “I’m sorry. I seem to have
said or done something to upset you.” This is a heartfelt apology;
he looks into my eyes, maybe even touches my shoulder or grabs my
hand. Not the snarky “sorry” you throw out because you feel like
you have to do it. You have to mean it for this to work.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Get
Curious.</B> Other times Paddy gets curious about why I might feel
the way I do and asks thoughtful questions about what I’m feeling
at the moment. These questions are motivated by caring and real
curiosity. I had found myself pretending to be caring and curious
when I was just asking questions to lead Paddy to say something so I
could “win” an argument or show him how wrong he was for feeling
the way he did. At times my questioning was both accusatory and
manipulative, and that is <I>not</I> how you do it. The intention of
your questions is to show you care, learn more about your partner,
build trust, and make your relationship a safe place to talk about
your innermost feelings. It’s scary at first, but <I>that</I> is
what makes a relationship last as long as life does.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>State
your case gently, without accusing your partner.</B> In some cases,
if I might be getting angry and Paddy’s emotions are in jeopardy of
escalating, he might say, “I’m feeling attacked.” In earlier
days when I knew I was actually attacking him, this statement might
have launched a full defensive, and then we would need to jump down
to the section about how to fight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">However,
nowadays my intention is never to attack him. I know attacking him
never brings the results I want. The results I want are for me to
feel loved and supported, for him to feel loved and supported, and
for us to have a deep, beautiful relationship. We both recognize our
disagreements deep down are often really discussions about fulfilling
each other’s needs. So now when he says this to me, it leads to an
immediate apology, saying I’m sorry because I did not intend for
him to feel attacked. Then I try to find a better way to say what I
need to say. Sometimes that happens right away, and other times it
takes longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">The
other funny thing about “hurtful, insensitive things,”
particularly with our partners, is we believe they should <I>know</I>
the things that hurt our feelings or make us angry. They should <I>know</I>
when they are doing hurtful and insensitive things, right? But even
after twenty years of marriage, I’m sometimes surprised by the
things that make Paddy defensive, and I’m equally surprised by the
things Paddy says and does that I take personally and allow to hurt
my feelings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Do
not assume you know how your partner is feeling or that your partner
knows how you are feeling—no matter how long you’ve been
together.</B> Instead of assuming, it is completely fair to ask your
partner how he or she is feeling. Again, get curious instead. My
tendency is still to judge if I am not intentional about the
curiosity. Meaning, if I say something I think is funny to Paddy and
he takes it very personally, I’ll almost immediately judge him and
say he is wrong for misunderstanding my intention. He should be
giving me the benefit of the doubt, I’ll think, and quit being so
sensitive. But see, you can’t, nor will you ever get to control
what your partner does or how they react.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>You
can only control what YOU do, so quit judging everyone else for what
they choose to do. Focus instead on YOUR part of what went down.
</B>Since you can only control yourself, focus on what you have said
or done (or the way you said it or did it) and figure out what you
could have done differently. There is power in this exercise, as you
recognize that you don’t need your partner to change their
behavior; you can change yours and see what happens.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">As
an example, it used to be that when Paddy had something on his face,
I would just wipe it off. For me, it was a way of showing love and
nurturing—<FONT COLOR="#252525"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">StorgēStorgē
(Love Between Children &amp; Parents)</SPAN></FONT> love, Act of
Service, and Physical Touch—a trifecta! It was intimate too;
because you would never do that to someone you didn’t care about
deeply. But sometimes, even if we were alone, Paddy would get upset
about it. He’d seem hurt or angry which made zero sense to me. I

for many years (and occasionally I still do it out of habit).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Then
one day it hit me: why was I insisting on still doing it when I knew
he didn’t like it? It was in part was because I know he doesn’t
want to wander around with cheese in his beard, but it was as much
because I felt like he was being stupid and I was being a loving
wife. Nonetheless, I realized I don’t want to do things that make
Paddy feel bad, and so I changed my approach. Now I just tell him if
he has cheese in his beard. It doesn’t bother him and there is no
skin off my back—I can kiss him or grab his hand or tickle his
back, or myriad other things to show love and nurturing.</P>

<B>HE SAID: Sometimes it’s just annoying</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I
don’t know why but it makes me feel I like a little kid who can’t
take care of himself, or a person so far gone they need someone to
else take care of them. I know it is my choice to feel that way and a
bigger person would choose to not act on that feeling. But sometimes
shit is just annoying, and that is the way it is. So I prefer to be
told that there is stuff on my face rather than be mothered. I guess

patience</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Tell
me if this sounds familiar: Sam said, did, or didn’t do something
in a way I didn’t like. I then either snapped back at her (Fight),
which kicked off a new shit storm because I made her feel unsafe and
attacked, or I became superbly annoyed and shut down or walked away
(Flight). Flight, in my opinion, can be a worse option, with one
exception: “putting yourself in timeout,” as Sam calls it. Flight
only works if you are taking some time to calm yourself down.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Unfortunately,
however, flight for me used to look a lot more like this: “I can’t
believe she said that. Fuck her.” I’d then walk away and
immediately start telling myself stories about why the whole thing
was Sam’s fault. That kind of storytelling typically does little
more than throw gas on the fire. And, unfortunately, it’s usually
false. So now I have taken something she </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">did</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">,
or said, or didn’t</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"> do</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">

started an inferno.</FONT></P>

might just have had something in her eye and was not rolling her eyes
at me. She might not have been thinking at all when she made that
comment and likely has no idea why it pissed me off. And no matter
how many times I forget, she still can’t read minds.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">It’s
the story I tell myself that actually causes the deeper hurt. That is
what we need to eliminate. I call that, “Don’t Own it!” which

Own It</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
used to own Sam’s shit for days. She would come home after a long
trip and be tired. I was excited and happy to see her. When she
didn’t show the same excitement and instead snapped at me because
she was tired, I would take it personally. Not only that, but I would
also build out an epic story about it, with varying plots and twists
and several possible surprise endings. Then I’d sulk off and be mad
while Sam was left wondering what was up with me.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Days
later, and after my pouting prompted her to keep asking what was
wrong, I might tell her. Even if she acknowledged her bad behavior,
Sam was usually completely blown away that I was still hanging on to
it and would </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">then</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
get annoyed at me for being such a “baby.” The whole process was
massively unhealthy and usually based on something silly that I then
compounded with fiction I had built in my head.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">But
that is what can happen when you “own someone else’s shit.”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
was talking with a friend a few days ago, and he expressed that he
had been angry with his spouse about something “unnecessary” she
said. She had asked him not be an ass when he came home because the
house was in a rare state of peace with the kids. Her goal was to
keep the peace and have a happy family. He took it as a personal
attack. He became annoyed that she would think this about him. “That
was the old me,” he said. “She should recognize that I have not
been that guy for several months.”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Well,
there are a few things wrong with that approach. The first being his
negative ownership of what she said. He should have just said “No
problem babe, see you soon,” then hung up and taken a minute to
calm down and recognize her intention to keep the peace and the
family happy. Sure she could have delivered it much better, but we
have to give each other a bit of room in this process. We will never
be perfect, and we can’t expect our spouse to be either.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Since
he chose to get upset and demand an apology, this well-intentioned
attempt at keeping the peace now turned into something different. He
added a whole new chapter to the story by insisting that she
recognize his efforts at improvement and not say something that
acknowledged his older bad behavior. He took it personally. He </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">owned</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
it. Again, no one is perfect, so even though we may slip and get
offended at something our partner says (I still do), the important
thing is to recognize it quickly and get </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">OVER
it</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">. Preferably before we get home and
anyone else notices!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434"><B>Okay,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">You
do not have control over someone else’s bad behavior. Rather than
stew about being treated poorly (your story), instead look inside and
see what triggers led up to the actions or words that made you upset.
Then think about how you may have contributed. Take </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">any</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">

if you have a perceived minuscule role, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">OWN

something to upset you earlier. You seemed very angry at me.”
Ninety-five percent of the time your spouse will immediately own
their bad behavior too: “I am sorry, too. It wasn’t you; it must
be…” The other five percent of the time, it just takes more time.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">When
I do slip up and start feeling hurt or annoyed, I like to catch
myself before or right after I open my mouth and say out loud,

being OVER it, “IT” is now behind us.</FONT></P>

might be a good time to talk about patience.</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">We
often give the people we work with or people outside of our marriage
a wide berth when it comes to our patience. Yet the people we love
the most, such as our partner, get a narrow margin in which to
operate. We come home from work, tired and expect the family to
recognize exactly where we are. (After all they know you better than
anyone and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>should</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
know how you feel and </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>should</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
know what to say or not to say…) WRONG. Our families deserve as
much or more of that same patience we give others. If we bring that
home, it will make an immediate difference in how we interact with
those we care about the most.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Last
year, I visited my dear friends Tim and Karen. They have been married
over twenty years and are real marriage warriors. But, they were in a
vicious circle when I visited. Tim had little patience, and Karen had
no patience for his impatience. This meant they were short with each
other frequently and that their love was on a downward curve.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">It
was largely because Tim was not focusing on his </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>Why</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">.
While I was confident that Karen would come around as soon as Tim
started to remember and focus on that, she was giving back what she
was getting for two reasons. First, she was annoyed at him for being
short with her, and second (and more importantly), she knew why his
fuse had been so short lately and was worried about him working too
hard. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">That worry and recognition </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">was</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
also manifesting itself as anger</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">. But no
way did Tim see that at the time; I wouldn’t either.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Tim
is in charge of sales for a very successful company. He has to manage
a sales and marketing force of all types of personalities, every day.
That requires a lot of patience. When he comes home, it takes very
little for him to become annoyed or lose patience with Karen. He is
starting to recognize that but has not done anything to change it.
Conversely, Karen is so used to getting little patience from him that
she, in turn, gives him about the same or less. After more than two
decades of marriage, this should not be. But it is also easy to do.
We have all been there. The good news is it is just as easy to fix
that vicious cycle as it is to fall into it.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">It
begins with patience.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">First,
we must agree that patience is a critical element to making a
relationship work. We should also recognize that patience is precious
in just about every other facet of life. When you catch yourself
snapping at or being short with your partner, ask yourself what other
things have been draining your energy and patience. Do those things
deserve to take precedence over your partner in life?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">That’s
when it’s time to step back and analyze what is important to you.
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>What is it all really about? </I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>Is</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>
there an endgame?</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"> Usually, the
endgame is that we are doing it to provide for our family and set up
some financial stability now and for the future. Right? Well, if your
family is important enough to sacrifice for at work, then they should
be every bit as important when you get home. I know you’re tired
and you probably just want to relax, but </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I>don’t
get lazy</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"> just because you crossed
your patience threshold.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Your
family deserves just as much effort (or more) as you apply at work or
outside of the home. If you can take a raft of shit from a client,
coworker or superior in stride, ride it out and come out of the
situation on the high ground, then there is no reason you can’t
come home and do the same thing. You just need to set your intention
before you walk through the door. The same way you do for the sales
team or your friends.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Even
if you use every tactic listed in the previous chapter, fights still
happen from time to time. But that doesn’t mean you can’t weather
the argument, end it quicker, and resolve the issues that caused it.
Here is what we do and why.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">
<B>SHE SAID—Get Your Head Right Before Opening Your Mouth Again</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Typically,
if things erupt into an argument or a full-on fight, it means we’ve
let things get out of control, our emotions are high, our defenses
are up, and we’re in it. These are the steps I take to get out of
it so we can work things out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Put
yourself in timeout.</B> When things get heated or even when someone
just gets annoyed and it escalates a tiny bit, you physiologically
turn into a monkey. Your body and mind turn to Fight or Flight mode,
as an uncomfortable amount of adrenaline starts pumping through your
veins and the blood rushes out of your head and into your muscles,
readying your body to take a swing or run away. Your brain isn’t
functioning at the top of its game in this state.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Without
a little redirection, you are likely going to escalate the situation
further needlessly. Sometimes redirecting means physically leaving
the situation, sometimes it is requesting a pause in the conversation
if you’re somewhere like an airplane or a car where you cannot
exit, and sometimes as you become more skilled in some of these
techniques, this is a deep breath and a moment. However, the timeout
happens, just make sure you wait until you feel calmer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Stay
in timeout until you figure out where YOU can take responsibility.
</B>Take a time out until <I>you</I> can figure out what <I>you</I>
did wrong to contribute to the argument. It takes two to tango, so
they say, and there is <I>always</I> something you did or did not do
that contributed to the escalation of the situation. If you haven’t
figured out what you did wrong or what you could have handled better,
you haven’t been thinking about it long enough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_Hlk482297171"></A>
<B>Forgive yourself.</B> Once you know what you can take
responsibility for, forgive yourself immediately for your
contribution to the argument. Forgiveness doesn’t mean forget or
repeat; it simply means love yourself enough to know, “I messed up.
I’m human. I love myself and know I am deserving of forgiveness for
my mistake.” Don’t beat yourself up about what you did. Apologize
for your mistake and commit to working harder. To quote Jenai Lane,
“We’re going for correction, not perfection.” A crazy thing
happens when you forgive yourself: You create the space and softness
necessary to forgive your partner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Forgive
your partner.</B> This moment of forgiveness isn’t anything you
verbalize; it is something you choose to feel. It simply means you
love your spouse enough to know, “You messed up. You’re human. I
love you and know you are deserving of forgiveness for your mistake.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Some
of you may be thinking, “But what if my partner isn’t sorry,
doesn’t admit to their contribution to the argument, and isn’t
even asking for forgiveness?” This may sound very strange to many
of you, but you don’t forgive them for them, you forgive them for
<I>you</I>. Holding grudges is horrible for you. It’s a gross
buildup of negativity that holds attention, space, and energy that
could all be better used to create the life of your dreams, express
more love, and find more happiness. So let it go. Forgiveness (not
only of yourself but of others too) is a critical aspect of
self-love. It puts you into a more open and loving mindset to take
you to the next step. (Sometimes this is easier said than done, so we
devoted a chapter to how to get to forgiveness and gratitude!)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>The
apologies, the analysis, and the make-up.</B> Because our lives are
so busy, Paddy and I will often let a fight blow over, and we’ll
leave the “post-mortem” for a time when we can be alone, relaxed
and when we’re sure each of us is ready to talk about it (meaning
we’ve moved through all of the steps previous). So sometimes, even
though we haven’t officially “made up,” we carry on with our
lives, working hard to express as much love as we normally do. If you
have truly forgiven yourself and your spouse, the make-up step is
something to bring closure and a brilliant way to bring your
relationship closer. (It also typically comes with great sex!)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">This
step requires some finesse if it is going to be handled properly and
deliver the outcome we want instead of starting another fight or
escalating the previous fight. So there are a couple of things we
need to know going into the apologies and the analysis stage. There
is a fantastic book about communication in difficult situations
called <I>Crucial Conversations</I>, which we’ve mentioned numerous
times. If you haven’t read this book yet, read it. It is written in
the context of doing business, but it applies to any and all
conversations—especially emotional ones. To paraphrase, a couple of
the critical concepts in this book in my words: Keep your eyes on the
prize, stick to the facts, and stay curious. Let’s take a closer
look at each concept.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Keep
Your Eyes on the Prize</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Keeping
your eyes on the prize is the idea of going into a conversation
knowing what you want to get out of it. …And I don’t mean the
petty things, like getting your point across or “winning” the
argument. I mean the BIG things: what you want out of the
communication and, ultimately, out of the relationship. This is the
PRIZE you should keep your eyes on.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">For
me in my relationship with Paddy, I want to be loved! I want to feel
valued, appreciated, cherished … and I want the same for Paddy. I
want our relationship and our love to last as long as our lives. This
is the BIG thing I want from my communications with Paddy. Turns out
holding this thought and intention when I am interacting with Paddy
makes all of those interactions much more likely to yield that result
than when I don’t focus on it. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">To
go back to the beginning of this section: You love your spouse, and
every interaction is an opportunity to express love. If your
communication isn’t in some way an expression of love, find a way
to make it one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Before
you go into the apology and analysis of a fight, you need to get your
head in the right place and set your intention. Your intention should
begin with wanting your partner to feel both safe and loved. Make
sure you are feeling loving towards your partner before you begin the
conversation. It’s not always easy, especially after a fight, but
there is an exercise that I find particularly helpful in getting
those bad feelings out in a constructive way. (I find it especially
helpful if I’m having trouble getting through to forgiving Paddy or
myself.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Write
down all the negative thoughts you have about your partner and the
situation and then burn it. DO NOT leave these things lying around.
Shred them, flush them—I find burning them particularly freeing—or
otherwise dispose of them so they can never be read by another living
soul. This is an opportunity for you to get your shit OUT.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Then,
I fill an entire page with all the things I love and appreciate about
my husband. If you’re not in a great place currently, go back to
when you fell in love and list all of those things. After an entire
page, you should have some warm fuzzies going for your partner that
will help get you in the right frame of mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Your
other intention should be to come to a resolution—even if that
resolution is to agree to disagree. A resolution with your partner
will allow you to move forward together, but hopefully, it will bring
a deepening of the relationship, a greater understanding of one
another, and a better appreciation of each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Facts
Only</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">When
fights escalate, the culprit often is our judgments, the stories we
tell ourselves about why someone did or said something or our
assessment of what kind of person they must be to have done it in the
first place. Exaggerations and generalizations—saying things like
“you always” or “you never”—tend to bear some blame too. If
you state only the facts when you are speaking, it helps disarm the
conversation. If you ignore your partner’s judgments,
exaggerations, and generalizations and bring it back to the facts, it
also helps disarm the conversation. Try to stick to the facts only
when you are speaking but also when you are listening.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I’ve
often said things like, “You were a total asshole,” while we were
trying to analyze a fight. <I>So. Not. Helpful.</I> While I might
argue otherwise at that moment, that kind of assessment is not a
fact. It’s a judgment, my opinion of Paddy’s actions or
attitudes. It’s much more productive to say something like, “You
said I embarrassed you and left the table suddenly. You never came
back and I was stuck with all of those people asking me what happened
and why you left.” These are facts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Telling
your partner how you felt as a result of what had happened is another
useful set of facts. So I might also say, “It left me feeling very
confused and uncomfortable because I didn’t know what I’d done to
embarrass you. I still don’t feel like I understand. I also felt
hurt and angry that you left me there.” These are statements of
fact about how you felt. H<I>owever, when you state the facts about
your feelings, be very mindful of how you word it.</I> If you say,
“You made me feel…” now you are assigning your partner blame
for your feelings as opposed to taking responsibility for them.
Instead, start with “I was feeling,” “I felt,” or “I feel,”
to differentiate your truths from universal truths.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>Curiosity
Kills Cats but Saves Relationships</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I’ve
brought up curiosity multiple times already, but it’s valuable in
the aftermath of a fight because it helps you get out of your own
head and allows room for new ideas, paradigm shifts, and
discoveries—not only about your partner but also about yourself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><B>We’re
Not Perfect Either…</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Recently
Paddy and I got into a big fight. We hadn’t fought in quite some
time (like maybe more than a year?), but then we found ourselves in
the middle of a pretty heated exchange about—wait for it—driving.
And it lasted for more than an hour! I think once we’d cooled off
we were both puzzled by why we’d fought so intensely about
something so petty. That is until we started tallying up what was
happening in our lives. We were both going through significant job
changes, our children had recently left the nest, we had moved twice
the year before but weren’t totally happy with our new place and
were considering moving again. Our stress levels were extremely high
with so many changes in recent months.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Sometimes
you have to take the pulse of your lives. Take a little inventory of
your respective stress levels. Are you in the middle of a job change?
Are you moving? Has anything traumatic happened to you or your
family?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_moota9m9z97d"></A>
We started calling this stress phenomenon, which had contributed to
more than one argument, the “boiling point.” During less
stressful times our boiling point is higher, meaning we don’t boil
over until the temperature is very high. During more stressful times,
it takes much less. And it’s during these times that we need to be
more gentle and loving to our partners and ourselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I

(after twenty years) and he learned I really could shut my mouth in
the car. Well, mostly. Correction, not perfection.</P>

have never been in an accident while driving the family. In fact, I

am not sure what it is about being behind the wheel of a moving

almost always get super defensive when Sam criticizes my driving. The
argument she mentions above was exactly like that. We didn’t
resolve anything that night, but later by asking questions of both
Sam and myself, we came to a resolution.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">A
question I had to ask myself was, “Why do I get so defensive?” My

completed safely?”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">The
answers are not as important as the realizations we both had. Mine
was that I needed to stop getting so defensive. It has gotten me

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If
you are ever arguing after having some drinks, stop. It will likely
never end well. Arguments can end well, as Sam explained, but when
alcohol is involved, we are usually devoid of the ability to utilize
all that we have learned. Alcohol twists reality in our minds and
gives us a fictional view, while also imploring us to defend it
passionately. But it is not true.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">How
many have had an ugly argument while buzzed on booze, then felt a bit
embarrassed the next day when you realized how trivial it was? My
hand is in the air right now. I can’t even count the times this has
happened to us. Fortunately, we have put most of it behind us, but I
can say that drinking was usually a factor when we fought more
regularly.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">When
you drink, your filter dissipates, and you start saying what you are
thinking. Some of it may be honesty, but a significant part of it is
tainted by misperception and the stories we have told ourselves, then
amplified by alcohol. And when we go after someone else with a
half-truth or fiction based on a misperception, they will go straight
to defense mode and then counter attack with their own tales
(especially if they’re buzzed too).</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">It
may be easier to say than do, but when alcohol is involved, you must
agree to table the topic to a time when you are both more
clearheaded. If your partner refuses to do that, remove yourself from
the argument however you can. You can’t win; no one can.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">When
I realize I have let things escalate to an argument, I usually start
thinking about how I can get the hell out of it. I do this by asking
myself a few questions. Then by asking Sam questions. The first
question is:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I><B>Is
this about being right</B></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I><B>?</B></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
Often it is and being right is about winning, so we stand our ground.
But when you insist you are right, the other person gets defensive
because you are effectively saying they are wrong.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">On
to the next question: </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I><B>Does it
matter at all?</B></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">Sometimes
it is just stupid, and my answer is that</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
I don’t really care one way or the other. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">So
in this instance, even if I think I was right, I’ll bow out. “You
know what, babe? I am sorry. It really doesn’t matter enough to me
to argue about it</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">.” </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">Then,
either concede the argument and let them “win,” or ask them: </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I><B>What
is it you want to achieve from this?</B></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">
Then give them that.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If
it does matter to you and you are still in the argument, this then
begs the question: </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">Are we arguing about
facts, or is my point of view based on opinion? </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">You
can get out of an argument by focusing on what is factual and then
proposing a solution. If Sam and I are arguing over facts, one of us
will usually suggest a bet to settle the disagreement. We have a
standing bet that involves a back rub or a blowjob. “Fine, the
usual?” “Deal!” This is when it’s my favorite time to be
right.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">If
the argument is based on opinion, know that you’re unlikely to
change your partner’s mind right there and then. Usually, emotions
are too high, and you’re not talking about the same set of facts
anyway—you’re talking about your stories. If it is your opinion
you are defending, acknowledge that either party could be right based
on their view, and express a desire to avoid further confrontation on
the topic. This creates a safe exit for both sides.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Other
questions I ask myself go back to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">Don’t
own it</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">Own
it,</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"> from the last chapter. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I><B>Am

times arguments get escalated by something someone says that ignites
more defensiveness. By being vulnerable and explaining what was said
and how you feel, you can help wind down the argument. Sam will often
say, “I did not intend to make you feel that way.” At that point,
I need to move on and no longer let what she said continue to
influence the conversation. If I continue to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">own
it</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">, we will continue to argue.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
also ask myself the question: </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I><B>Is
it possible I can take responsibility for something that has upset
her?</B></I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">You
are correct; I am talking about </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">Own It</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">.
If I can take a deep breath, accept some responsibility, and then
apologize for it, most arguments dissolve right there. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434"><I><B>Don’t

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">are not only great tools to discourage
an argument, but they are also helpful for getting out of an
argument.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Lastly,
try humor. LudusLudus (Friendship Love) is huge for me in avoiding
confrontation. If I can recognize we are acting stupid and then
divert the whole thing with some form of playfulness or random humor,
we both win. Most of the time when I do that we both instantly
recognize that we were being dumb and laugh about it instead. This is
my second favorite outcome to ending an argument.</FONT></P>

is, stated simply, insecurity. However, jealousy is a tough one for
many people to work through. It seems to be deeply seated in our
psyches, especially if we’ve experienced abandonment or betrayal.
It also gets fed by our society as an unavoidable emotion that
justifies atrocious acts. Even our justice system acknowledges fits
of jealous rage—or “crimes of passion” which we now refer to as
“temporary insanity”—as a justified defense for violent crimes
including murder.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote26anc" HREF="#sdfootnote26sym"><SUP>26</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">I
can speak to this topic from about fourteen years of living it. For
me, it started with one bad experience. My quest for improvement
would later teach me that the experience was a huge insecurity
problem transferred to me by someone who also had massive insecurity
issues. Of course, I had no clue then and was new enough to the game
that I played right into it.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">My
first real relationship where the words “I love you” got tossed
around, did not take place till I was twenty-six. I know, I know, I
was a late bloomer. I had lived with this girl for about four months
when things started to feel wrong. There were clues and
inconsistencies everywhere that she might not be telling me the truth
about her other relationships. I prefer the truth, so when she was
being inconsistent, I would call her on it. Then she’d accuse me of
being an asshole or of being insecure.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">She
would have been right had not every single clue turned out in the end
to be absolute fact. My gut told me early on that something was not
right and that she was not being honest with me, but I hung on
because I was steered into second-guessing that gut feeling. I stayed
for almost a year. Not much time really, I agree. But when the time
is spent planting deep seeds of jealousy and insecurity, it is
plenty. I don’t like blaming my bad behavior on others; it is MY
behavior. I get that. I only bring up this relationship because I had
never had an issue with jealousy that I know of before this happened.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">The
irony is that this girl used to get super jealous when it came to my
female friends. I thought it was kind of cute at the time, but I now
know that her jealousy came from knowing what she was doing with all
of the guys she swore to me were “just friends.” Anyway, that is
where it all began, the backstory for my jealousy. That relationship
left me bitter for years after our breakup. I had trust issues, (aka
jealousy issues) which then impacted my relationship with Sam. She
knew the backstory and for a while was empathetic. Sam even created a
nickname for the old girlfriend that I won’t repeat.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">Fast-forward
to my marriage with Sam. As you already know our marriage is a tale
of two very different decades. In decade one I had trust and jealousy
issues that helped erode our relationship as much as any other
factor.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">Sam,
as you will read, has no concept of jealousy. She just does not
understand it. While empathetic in the beginning, she was much less
patient with my jealousy later on. Most relationships that have one
jealous partner will go this way unless the beast is released.
Releasing that green-eyed monster can be tough once you have
experienced the pain of cheating (either emotionally or
physically—there isn’t much difference, as they are both usually
tied to feelings for someone else and the lying that goes with them).</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">So
the question is: How do I stop the monster and kill it forever?</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">My
answer is that you may never kill it. Now, before you get pissed at
me, hear me out! I say you might never kill it because the majority
will not. I haven’t. I have caged it though, and it is not getting
out. I can still hear its cries from time to time. And now and then
it might influence my thinking if I let it. I can feel its hand in my
pocket fishing around for the keys to the lock… Whack! Get out of
there!! And I’m back! So yes, those thoughts pop up from time to
time and sometimes out loud. But I am quick to lock that thought away
or say something like, “Oh shit that sounded insecure. Sorry, babe,
ignore that.”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">Listen,
bottom line, jealousy is insecurity. It is you telling yourself: I
may not be good enough. It is you worrying that your partner might
leave you for someone “better.” Sometimes it is the fear of being
alone and starting over. It means you need work on loving yourself.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">The
key for me to overcoming my jealousy was recognizing it is an
insecurity that had a negative impact on my relationships. That was
not who I wanted to be anymore. I wanted to be a person who has
enough self-value/self-love that I don’t worry about those things I
have no control over. To know that no matter what someone else does
or does not do, I will be good. For my relationship, it is not a
question of trusting her or not trusting her. The choice you must
make is to give one hundred percent trust. That is all you have
control over.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">To
not trust someone is the end. You will never succeed in your
relationship if you can’t give it all of your trust. At some point,
you must get there. The thoughts may rise up now and again, but you
need to recognize them for what they are, give yourself love, and
remind yourself of what you do have control over. Then do more of
that.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">No
matter what happens. Jealousy is a beast that needs to be caged
forever. Because even if the worst scenario happens and your
significant other cheats and the relationship ends, you do not want
to carry that baggage along with you into your next healthy
relationship. It will serve nothing positive in that relationship,
ever.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">Using
our experience as an example, after I started traveling, Paddy would
ask me constantly if everything was okay, if there was anything I
wanted to tell him, and if I was sure there wasn’t anything going
on I needed to tell him about. This was during the time I had many
male friendships developing. I’ve always had male friends, so this
was not unusual nor did I consider it to be threatening to our
relationship.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">I
would tell him about my male friends and the friendships that were
developing and the flirting that may have taken place, but it never
seemed to appease him. He continued to ask those questions, focusing
on what I might be doing wrong that was causing his discontent with
our relationship as opposed to focusing on what he might be able to
improve himself to get us back on track. (We were both guilty of
that.)</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">I
felt that, by continuing to ask me those questions, he was already
accusing me of cheating. After months of feeling accused, I started
to think, “Well, if he thinks I’m guilty of cheating anyhow, I
might as well cheat because I’m already being punished for the
crime.”</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">If
Paddy had not been so jealous and accusatory would I have had those
emotional affairs? I don’t know. I might still have had them.
However, what I can tell you is that Paddy’s jealousy was a wedge
between us that made it difficult to navigate everything else. No
matter how much I would tell him I loved him and nothing was going
on, his jealous green-eyed monster wouldn’t let him believe me.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">If
you’re like me and jealousy isn’t something you experience or
understand all that much, focus on making yourself the very best
partner you can be. Make the healthy parts of your relationship so
strong that any weaknesses such as jealousy don’t matter. Do all
the things we teach in this book, and you’ll have a sound
relationship. It makes sense to me that when people get what they
need from their relationship—mostly a feeling they are loved—they
don’t stray.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222"><B>Another
Perspective</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">There
have been other times in our marriage when we’ve been out, and men
are talking to me—maybe they are flirting with me, and maybe I’m
flirting back—and Paddy gets jealous and angry. I remember one
night in particular when I met a man on the dance floor who had the
same medical condition as I do and I ended up spending over an hour
talking to him. It wasn’t flirtatious in my opinion, and we
exchanged some interesting information, but Paddy was furious. I
honestly did not (do not) understand why on earth he would feel that
way.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">Here
is my perspective on those types of situations: I’ve watched Paddy
flirt with other women, and I’ve watched women fall all over
themselves trying to impress Paddy. I get some enjoyment from
watching these scenes go down. Flirting is fun, and I can see Paddy
is having fun! When women are all over Paddy, it boosts his
confidence, which is sexy to me. I say, flirt away!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">The
way I see it is that it has nothing to do with me. I’m not naïve
enough to think Paddy will never be attracted to someone else—there
are millions of hot, fun, smart women out there. I’m also not naïve
enough to think Paddy won’t ever think or even fantasize about
other women—a previous lover, someone he’s met, or even an
imaginary one. I fully expect him to be attracted to other women and
be attractive to other women, too. It’s natural; it is how men are
built, and doesn’t have anything to do with our relationship or me.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">Those
feelings (which we cannot control, only our actions) are not a
violation of the feelings we have for each other unless he decides to
act on them and he would have to act on them in a fairly significant
way before I felt threatened. Instead, I feel proud to be the one
going home with him and if I did feel threatened in any way (this has
yet to happen) I think I would move in on the situation. I would go
lay a big wet kiss on him, grab his ass, and join his conversation.
Since I feel this way, I expect everyone to feel this way.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">I’ve
found out I’m in the minority on jealousy. When I describe this to
people, they usually say, “Oh, that’s because you’ve never had
anyone cheat on you.” Not true. My first love from high school, my
boyfriend on and off for three years, cheated on me. It did make me
feel sick, and I threw up (but it turned out I had the stomach flu,
so I’m unclear as to whether this was jealousy or not).</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#222222">Maybe
consider changing your thinking? I’ve never lost any sleep over
jealousy and, from what Paddy has told me about how it feels, I’m
pretty glad I haven’t.</FONT></P>

forgiveness, and love all go hand in hand in hand. You won’t ever
find PragmaPragma (Truly Loving) if you don’t learn how to feel and
express all of these. This goes foremost for loving yourself because
it’s the most effective way you can carry it over to loving others.
While gratitude can be a way of showing appreciation for your

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Along
with loving yourself, being grateful is essentially the gateway to
loving. By showing gratitude and saying the words to each other and
ourselves, we are expressing love. The more gratitude we show for all
that is around us, the closer we get to experiencing total Agape
love. (All loving, like Buddha and Jesus, remember?) The easiest
place to practice gratitude is to be grateful for your loved ones and
all they do.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Gratitude,

Little Things</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">In
a relationship, many things get done that benefit all parties. These
are things partners do FOR themselves AND each other. Going to work
every day, wheeling, dealing, and making things happen are all things
we do to succeed, and that ultimately benefit the whole family. So is
doing a load of laundry, going to the bank, grocery shopping, and
about a thousand other little things that have to get done. In a
perfect world, everything would be equal; all chores, all income and
all household administrative work would split right down the middle.
We can dream. But the only real way to balance the inequity is to
express massive amounts of gratitude for time spent devoted to a team
function.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Be
grateful for your partner and all they do; it is critical in your
relationship. No one task can be looked on as </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">more
important </FONT><FONT COLOR="#343434">than another when it comes to
gratitude. You are either grateful for it, or you are not. By being
grateful for it, you elevate its importance at that moment and
acknowledge your partner for it. You show your partner love for doing
what they do. It helps us to keep doing it. How many times have you
heard “Why should I? No one seems to care.” That is just
indifference, trained by a lack of gratitude. If we express heartfelt
gratitude for all we do for each other, that indifference can’t
exist.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">I
am grateful for all that Sam is, not just what she does. When I focus
on the things that I am grateful for in her, it is impossible for me
to do anything but love her completely. If I concentrate on the
things I love most about myself, there is less room for the judgy
negativity. If I focus on what I love most about the world, there is
less room for everything that is not right. Gratitude is the ultimate

called Irish Alzheimer’s Disease; you forget everything except the
grudge.” A friend told me that once. It is mostly funny, but it
also rang a bit true for me. Many times I didn’t remember exactly
why I didn’t like or was mad at someone. I just knew I was.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Forgiveness
is something I have learned much from Sam about. Learning about it
and practicing it are two different things, however. It has taken me
some time to get decent at forgiveness. I am getting better at
forgiving others for past indiscretions and letting things go because
of her help. And when it happens it is a huge weight off my shoulders
that rarely comes back. So I do recognize how important it is for
mental well-being.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><FONT COLOR="#343434">Forgiving
myself is a whole other can of worms. It goes back to self-love and
being able to forgive yourself for lack of perfection. For me, that
is fucking hard. But I try to do it every day and am happy to report
that I am also getting better it. I told you in the beginning that I
was far from perfecting self-love, but I do recognize how critical it
is and how forgiveness is the key to its mastery.</FONT></P>

I’m going to start with forgiveness. I will be honest and say I did
not understand forgiveness until two years ago, but this realization
of what forgiveness truly is has completely changed me and all of my
relationships.</P>

I thought forgiveness was something you granted to other people when
they had apologized for their wrongdoings and were, well, <I>worthy

Nelson Mandela is one of the most brilliant embodiments of
forgiveness. Imprisoned for twenty-seven years for his work against
apartheid in South Africa, he forgave everyone involved in his
imprisonment as he walked out of the prison.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_qlipi6o4q7ug"></A>
Using my definition of forgiveness, all of the people who imprisoned
him—all of the people who kept him imprisoned and who mistreated
him while he was in prison—they were not apologizing or asking for
forgiveness, so the entire first step of my forgiveness process is
completely missing! How can you forgive someone who isn’t asking
for (nor do they want) your forgiveness? Using my model, forgiveness
is for the one being forgiven.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_7vjpomf074l7"></A>
Forgiveness is not for the person or people you are forgiving.
Forgiveness is for yourself.  Nelson Mandela knew if he held onto all
the negative feelings against his captors, he would still be
imprisoned—emotionally.</P>

I have been a grudge-holder most of my life. My dad was a
grudge-holder, and he was my hero, so I became a grudge-holder too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">About
a year after my dad died, I had a significant falling out with my mom
and my sister. There was plenty of finger pointing and blame to go
around without resolution. This was when my grudge against them
began. After three years, this grudge-holding became more burdensome
and painful than the things that had hurt me in the first place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_b49v0jqqb4as"></A>
In my mind, they turned from being my close loved ones to my enemies.
I spent lots of time and energy engaged in very negative thoughts and
feelings towards them. As much as I wanted to amend my relationships
with them on some level, there was no indication they felt the same
way; they did not appear to care whether they had hurt me and they
were not seeking my forgiveness. I spent lots of time also feeling
sorry for myself. I felt rejected, unloved, and spent a ton of time
wallowing in self-doubt and wondering what all must be wrong with me
that I had become unworthy of their love. All of these things weighed
on me so very heavily that I became not only depressed but was
diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and developed debilitating panic
attacks.</P>

I wish I could tell you I figured out what needed to happen myself.
It wasn’t until I was going through that spiritual training class I
mentioned earlier with Jenai Lane that I finally understood what
forgiveness is and why it matters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">Holding
those grudges was in not hurting my mom or sister for all I knew. I
did know it was hurting me—and not just emotionally. It was now
affecting my physical health in a tangible way. For me to heal
myself, I needed to forgive. I needed to let go of what I felt was
wrongdoings and forgive them. I also needed to forgive myself for
whatever I had done as a part of this unfolding drama, even if I
wasn’t sure exactly what it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_w64wbvz3uee6"></A>

for good.</P>

Jenai has two brilliant tools for learning and practicing
forgiveness. One is called “Let Go and Know,” and the other is
called “Forgive for Good.” Both can be found in her book <I>Spirit
Led Instead</I>. READ this book! It has many great tools in it—I’ve
found them very helpful for increasing my emotional intelligence,
self-knowledge, and well-being—not to mention my spirituality!
Better yet, sign up for one of her many workshops or one-on-one
coaching. You won’t regret it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">I

If you took the time to do this, do you feel a little lighter, a bit

We have an acquaintance named John Berghoff who teaches something
called Appreciative Inquiry<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote27anc" HREF="#sdfootnote27sym"><SUP>27</SUP></A>.
It’s a revolutionary method of helping organizations and systems to
evolve to become their best and strongest. This approach starts by
focusing on everything that is going WELL in the organization or
system, unlike many other methods that center on solving problems.
The idea is to strengthen the strengths so much that the weaknesses
are irrelevant. What if you could do this in your relationship?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_jxo2jtmeevz"></A>
The first step is to spend time fully appreciating your partner and
your relationship. As Paddy mentioned, some of this gratitude may be
for things your partner does. Some of it may be appreciation for your
partner. Some may stem from what your relationship has allowed you,
given you, taught you. It is a great exercise to foster feelings of
deep love for your partner. You may have to go back to when you felt
very loving towards your partner if you are in a place where you’re
finding it difficult to find the positive. But there is always
something you can find that is positive about your partner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_yibxba3fl1t"></A>
What you focus on grows. When you choose to be grateful, you’ll
focus on all the positive things and strengths. Then they’ll grow,
and so will all of that positive energy gratitude generates!</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><A NAME="_9a9abklpc2ms"></A>
The next step is to spend some time envisioning the picture of your
ideal relationship! How do you spend your time together? What do you
feel when you are together? How does your partner feel when you are
together? How do things work in your household if you live together?
What kind of activities do you do together to have fun? This is time
for you to really think about what you want and need from a
relationship.</P>

A friend recently told me her parents, who’ve been married multiple

something to look forward to together. Take some time to design that
thing to look forward to together—a loving, thriving, healthy

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Conclusion</B></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
wish there were some quick fix or pill you could take to make your
relationship so strong it will last as long as your life. We wish we
could promise you a smooth sailing kind of love forever. We wish this
book were full of easy answers. But if all those dreams came true,
there’d be little opportunity for the transformative growth that so
often comes from meaningful, long-term, committed relationships.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">And
that’s what we’ve really been talking about this whole time,
isn’t it? This book is about transformation. It’s about paradigm
shifts. It’s about developing some new habits and dropping some old
ones. It’s about change and not giving up even though you continue
to stumble and make mistakes. It’s about endeavor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
believe the love bond you create with your significant other is one
of the strongest bonds in the universe. If we can help strengthen
that relationship and the love it is built around, then our first
mission is accomplished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
also believe there is a worldwide crisis. Love itself is under siege.
If you turn on the news, it will take about two minutes to recognize
the world needs more people who understand how to love and its
greater purpose. You must begin with understanding and loving
yourself. Once that is accomplished, you will be the best equipped to
share your love with others. Learning about love won’t just help
you in your relationship but, more importantly, it helps you
understand what it means to love and love well, and how to give and
receive love in healthy, powerful, resonant ways. The better all of
us understand and implement this, the more we believe love will grow.
If we can start a movement to increase love in a place as simple as
our homes, then maybe it can extend to our neighborhoods, towns,
cities, countries, and the crisis can be averted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%"><I>Bigger
Love</I> is a combination of our story, how we saved our relationship
and what valuable tools we have picked up along the way. It doesn’t
have all the answers, and it is not a definitive book within its
category (as no book really can be) but we hope that you will
recognize and appreciate it for what we intended. That is a book
written as a guideline and a tool that entices you to want to learn
more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">If
we can learn to love ourselves better, we will become much more
accomplished at loving others. If we become more consistent and
skilled at giving and receiving love, then maybe those who feel its
warmth and see its great beauty will strive to spread that love. The
more love we spread, the better the world becomes. We believe this is
the meaning of life. We can’t think of a better gift to give the
world than love.</P>

this book. Our hats are off to your love endeavor! We would also be
so very appreciative if you would join our Facebook community -

challenges you’ve had or are having through your own love
endeavors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
want to thank our children, Jacob and Claire, for teaching us about
love as no one else could. We want to thank our parents—Betty and
Denny, Dale and Ed—whose long-lasting relationships have taught us
so much.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">We
want to thank all of our friends who were willing to share their
stories—both intentionally and unintentionally, named and
unnamed—therefore helping make the book more interesting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in; line-height: 200%">And
a very special thank you to Dan Cullinane who has been our counsel in
love since the beginning and who also provided his invaluable

self-talk. You think the criticism and judgment are justified. But
think again about your loved one. Are those messages ever justified?
Is that kind of treatment ever justified? Is it ever okay to knock
someone down with negativity? You wouldn’t let anyone else do that
to your loved one, you wouldn’t do that to someone else, so you
have to stop doing it to yourself.</FONT></P>

that I bet that moment was a top-five moment in your relationship. So
why not go there again? And again? It is hard, but not impossible. We
can achieve hyper-focus if we really put in the effort to make it
happen. Here is where I restate the theme of this book for the nth

watching other people like, admire, love, or have any other positive
feelings towards your partner can bring those same emotions to the
surface in YOU. When we first moved to Kansas City, we didn’t have
many friends. One of my fondest memories was when we came back to
Utah for our Christmas vacation, and we went out with a bunch of
Paddy’s friends. As I watched him interact with people he was
comfortable with, people who knew him really well and loved him, I
fell back in love with him all over again! Those people helped me
remember all the reasons I fell in love with Paddy in the first place
and he was definitely at his best too, filled with joy and passion
and love for those longtime friends. Sometimes you can just see your
partner through another person’s eyes—someone who adores them—and
you can feel those same adoring feelings fill you up!</FONT></FONT></P>

experience we won’t ever forget. That may be a bit extreme for
some, but there are many other things couples can do in this
category. Here are some examples of things our friends have talked
about that they did as a couple: running a marathon, running a 5k,
diving with sharks, skydiving, climbing a BIG mountain, hiking parts
